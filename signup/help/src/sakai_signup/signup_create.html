<h2>Sign-up Tool: Creating meetings</h2>

<p>To create a meeting:</p>
<p>
</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>
<strong>Click Add,</strong>
then choose the type of meeting and complete all the required information about dates, times and 

place of meeting.
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Title</strong>
:&nbsp; This field will identify the meeting in this site&#8217;s list of meetings<strong>.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Location</strong>
:&nbsp; This field will appear in the Meeting Details.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Description</strong>
:&nbsp; This field appears on the Meeting Details and the student Sign-up screen.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Start Time</strong>:&nbsp; Fill out the date (with, optionally,
the date picker) and the time showing when the meeting will
begin.&nbsp; The 24-hour clock is not available, so AM and PM must be used.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>End Time</strong>:&nbsp; Fill out the date (with, optionally,
the date picker) and the time showing when the meeting will end.&nbsp;
The 24-hour clock is not available, so AM and PM must be used.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Meeting frequency</strong>:&nbsp; To set up recurring meetings,
choose an option here.&nbsp; Any of the meeting types can be
recurring.&nbsp; Selection of a meeting frequency
other than &#8220;Once Only&#8221; will create a series of entries in the meetings
table with the same name but different details, where any of the
individual entries can be modified as necessary (see &#8220;Editing a
meeting&#8221;).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Sign-up begins</strong>:&nbsp; Enter the point at which the
meeting should be opened for sign-up.&nbsp; Before then, participants
will not have an active Sign-up button next to a meeting entry.&nbsp; To 
allow immediate sign-up, choose &#8220;Start Now&#8221; from the drop-down box.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Sign-up ends</strong>:&nbsp; Enter the point relative to the
meeting at which to close the sign-up process.&nbsp; This blocks
further sign-up by participants, and also
blocks cancellation of a meeting for which a participant has already
signed up.&nbsp; This period is measured from the scheduled meeting
end, allowing sign-up even after the meeting has started, when that is appropriate.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Available to</strong>:&nbsp; This field allows you to determine
who can sign up for the meeting.&nbsp; You can limit sign-up to members
of a group (defined on this site) or
extend the sign-up offer to the membership of other sites, by selecting
the appropriate checkboxes.&nbsp; The option to extend to other sites
allows inclusion of those sites&#8217; members, or groups defined there.&nbsp; The
other site must also have the Sign-up Tool in order for its members to
participate.&nbsp; Default:&nbsp; Available to members of this site
only.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong><a href="content.hlp?docId=signup_meetingType">Meeting Type</a></strong>:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The relevant options for each of the three meeting types appear when that meeting type is selected 

via its radio button.
</p>

<p>
<em>Open meeting</em>
&#8212;&nbsp; No relevant options.
</p>

<p>
<em>Single slot</em>
&#8212;&nbsp;Options to choose between Max number (in which case, enter the number of participants 

allowed) and Unlimited.
</p>

<p>
<em>Multiple slots</em>&#8212;Options create timeslots, either (1) computed
to occupy a single continuous time span, or (2) occupying separate
irregular time spans manually defined, covering one or more days.&nbsp; Each method 
creates a single meeting with multiple entries in a timeslot table.&nbsp;
</p>
</li>
<ol type='a'>
<li>
<p>Number of slots available for sign-up:&nbsp; Enter
the number of individual timeslots over which to divide the meeting time.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Number of participants per slot:&nbsp; Enter the number of people that can sign up for each slot.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Estimate duration per timeslot (min):&nbsp; This figure, in red, is
calculated as a function of the total meeting time span and the number
of slots available, and cannot be edited.&nbsp; It allocates the available time
across the slots.&nbsp; For example, if the number of slots is defined
to be 5, and the start and end times of the meeting span two hours, the duration
will be set to 24 (120 minutes divided by 5).&nbsp; A number of slots
that does not divide the period evenly will give rise to a warning message and an
adjustment of the total span.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; In any case, the
resulting timeslots can be edited, after the meeting is published, through the
&#8220;Modify&#8221; process by selecting &#8220;Advanced user-defined
timeslots.&#8221;&nbsp; See below, &#8220;Editing a meeting.&#8221;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advanced user-defined timeslots: &nbsp;Allows a
multiple-slot meeting to be defined as a set of irregular timeslot
choices, over several days at different times.&nbsp; (Each person can sign up for
only one.)&nbsp; Select this checkbox,&#8221; then select the &#8220;Edit
Timeslots&#8221; link that appears. &nbsp;Enter new timeslots with the &#8220;Add a
new timeslot&#8221; link, edit the data, and delete extraneous ones
with the red X.&nbsp; This option does not allow unlimited
participation.&nbsp; A warning that this meeting covers more than one
day can be ignored.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</ul>


<li>Continue to the second page (using <strong>&#8220;Next&#8221;</strong>), the Meeting Summary, to
verify the details set so far, then complete the meeting settings, as follows.
</li>

meeting settings, as described below.&nbsp;</p>
