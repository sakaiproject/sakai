<h2>Sign-up Tool: Creating meetings </h2>
<p>There are three types of events or meetings:</p>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Multiple slots:</strong> a single time slot can be divided into
     any number of meetings of equal length. For example, a two hour 
meeting could
     have four half-hour slots or eight quarter-hour slots. For each slot there
     is a maximum number of participants. Participants are required to 
sign up. <br />
     <br />
   </li>
   <li><strong>Single slot:</strong>     a single time slot is created and the
     number of participants can be limited or unlimited. Participants 
are required
     to sign up.<br />
     <br />
   </li>
   <li><strong>Announcement:</strong> creates a single time slot for 
an event or meeting. Participants
     are not required to sign up.</li>
</ul>
<p>To create a meeting:</p>
<ol>
   <li><strong>Click Add,</strong> then choose the type of meeting and
       complete all the required information about dates, times and 
place of meeting. <br />

         <br />
   </li>
