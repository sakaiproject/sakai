<h2>
Sign-up tool:&nbsp; Editing a meeting
</h2>

<p>Clicking on a meeting title shows the Meeting Details page and its
timeslot table, with lists of participants signed up.&nbsp; The
participants may be changed here, using the &#8220;Add Participants&#8221; link, 
the delete buttons beside individual entries, or the options for changing and swapping
assigned timeslots shown on the edit icons beside individual entries.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>To change any of the initial settings of the meeting, use the
&#8220;Modify&#8221; option shown at the top of Meeting Details.&nbsp; The
information described in &#8220;Creating meetings&#8221; will be shown for editing the settings
of your choice.&nbsp; The timeslots can be adjusted by selecting
&#8220;Advanced user-defined timeslots&#8221; (if not already specified for this
meeting), then selecting the &#8220;Edit Timeslots&#8221; link that
appears; timeslots can be combined, removed, or added. &nbsp;In a
recurring meeting, you can choose to limit the change by selecting
&#8220;Modify current only&#8221; or to &nbsp;modify all of the sessions in the rest of the
series by selecting &#8220;Modify all future recurring meetings.&#8221;&nbsp; 
After modifying a meeting, you may elect to send e-mail notification to participants 
via the checkbox above the timeslot table.
</p>

<p>To lock or cancel a timeslot, click it in the timeslot table and use
the options presented underneath it.&nbsp; Note that you can first move participants 
to another timeslot using the edit buttons beside individual entries as described above.
</p>

<p>
To copy a meeting:&nbsp;
<br>Click on the meeting name to open the details, and then click the
&#8220;Copy&#8221; link at the top.&nbsp; You now have a display entitled &#8220;Copy
this meeting&#8221;.&nbsp; Change the settings as desired, including the
title if you want a new meeting name, and click &#8220;Publish New
Meeting.&#8221;&nbsp; Some settings will not be available to edit.&nbsp; You
cannot copy a multiple-slots meeting into a new single-slot meeting, for instance.&nbsp;
