<h2>Sign-up tool: suggestions for use </h2>
<p>The Sign-up tool can be used in a variety of ways and the list below is by
   no means exhaustive. </p>
<ol>
   <li>Use the Sign-up tool to allow students to sign up in advance for office
     hours.&nbsp; Because you can break up the total time  into individual
     slots it allows both you and the students to make better use of 
your time. <br />
     <br /></li>
   <li>To schedule in-class presentations either by individuals or by 
small groups,
     set up multiple time slot meetings within a class time to allow a fixed
     time for each presenter. Ask the students to indicate the topic of their
     presentation by typing it in the comment area when they sign up.  <br />
     <br />
     </li>
   <li>The Sign-up tool is 'group and section aware' which gives TFs
     the ability to set up office hours or meetings which are visible only to
     their sections or to a group.
     <p><strong>Note:</strong> To set up a group, click <strong>Site
         Info</strong> then <strong>Manage
       Groups</strong>. </p>
</li>
   <li>To get an estimate of how many students would attend a review session,
     set up a meeting with no limit on the number of participants who can sign
     up. This is useful in choosing a room of adequate size for the 
session. <br />
     <br />
   </li>
   <li>To save typing, you can set up multiple meetings of the same 
type by setting
     up one meeting and then Copy it as often as needed.  To
     copy a meeting, click the title, then click Copy at the top of the screen.
     After creating a copy of the original, click the name of the meeting, then
     <strong>Modify</strong> to make any changes. </li>
   </ol>
