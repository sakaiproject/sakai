<h3>Creating a forum</h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this
document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a
basic understanding of roles and permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>There are no default forums or topics in the Forums tool. No forums
will appear in this area until someone with an appropriate role
creates them. By default, participants (e.g., students) in a course
site cannot create forums.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When you create your forum, you'll need to
add at least one topic so site participants can post messages. The
forum will not be visible to participants unless a topic is added.</p>

<p>To create a new forum:</p>

<ol><li>In your site's <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>, click <strong><code>Forums</code></strong>. The
Forums screen will open.

<br /><br />
</li><li>At the top, click <strong><code>New Forum</code></strong>. The Forum Settings screen
will open.

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Forum Title" field, type your forum's title. This is a
required field, and is limited to 75 characters.

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Short Description" field, you may provide a brief
description (limited to 100 characters) that will be displayed along
with the title in the Forums area. 

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Description" field, you may enter an in-depth description
of your forum, and provide any associated information or
resources.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Attachments", you can attach a file from your local
computer or from Resources, or specify the URL for a file on the
web. For instructions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aupf">Options for adding attachments</a>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>To disable forum postings, under "Forum Posting", click the
<strong><code>Yes</code></strong> radio button next to "Lock Topic (Disable forum
postings)". <strong><code>No</code></strong> is selected by default, allowing site
participants to post messages about your forum topic.

<br /><br />
</li><li>To moderate forum postings, under "Forum Posting", click the
<strong><code>Yes</code></strong> radio button next to "Moderate Topics in Forum".
<strong><code>No</code></strong> is selected by default, allowing site participants to post
messages without moderation.
</li><li>
<p>Under "Permissions", you can modify permission levels for
participant roles (and groups, if you've created them; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=atcs">Managing groups</a>). To do so, from the list under
"Permissions", select a role (or group) for editing by clicking its
name. Then, next to "Permission Level:", use the drop-down list to
select from several predefined permission levels. Additionally, you
can create custom permission levels by clicking to enable or disable
the following functions:</p>
 
<ul><li><strong>New Forum:</strong> Create a new forum. You can modify this
option only via Template Settings.
</li><li><strong>New Topic:</strong> Create a new topic. You can modify
this option only via Template Settings or Forum Settings.
</li><li><strong>New Response:</strong> Create a new response to your
topic.
</li><li><strong>Response to Response:</strong> Send responses to a topic
response.
</li><li><strong>Post to Gradebook:</strong> Grade responses and add
comments. Send grades and comments to Gradebook.
</li><li><strong>Change Settings:</strong> Change the topic settings.
</li><li><strong>Read:</strong> Read topic responses.
</li><li><strong>Mark as Read:</strong> Mark messages as read.
</li><li><strong>Moderate Postings:</strong> Moderate messages posted to
forum (available if "Moderate Topics in Forum" option was selected
above).
</li><li><strong>Edit Postings:</strong> Use the radio buttons to
indicate which postings participants with the permission level can
revise (none, their own, or all postings).
</li><li><strong>Delete Postings:</strong> Use the radio buttons to
indicate which postings participants with the permission level can
delete (none, their own, or all postings).

  </li></ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Forum permission settings will apply to all 
subsequently created topics in that forum, but if you modify forum
permission settings after topics have been created, you must change
the topic permission settings separately.</p>

</li><li>Next to "Gradebook Item", use the drop-down list to choose
an item with which the forum should be associated.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To add an item to the
Gradebook, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aran">Adding, editing, or deleting a Gradebook item</a>.</p>
</li><li>When you're finished, click one of the following:

<br /><br />

<ul><li><strong>Save Draft:</strong> Save your forum as a draft. You'll
return to the Forums screen. Forums saved as draft will not be
available to site participants.
</li><li><strong>Save Settings &amp; Add Topic:</strong> Save your changes
and add a topic to your forum. You will need to add a topic so site
members can post messages.
</li><li><strong>Cancel:</strong> Cancel your changes; you'll return to the
Forums screen.
</li></ul>
</li></ol>
