<p><strong>Note:</strong> To change the default settings for certain
options in all future forums and topics you create, change the
template settings; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=bcss">Changing forum template settings</a>.  You can
override the template settings for individual forums and topics you
create by following the steps below.</p>

<a name="forum"> </a>

<h3>Creating a forum</h3>

<p>A default forum and topic is populated for each site.  To create a new
forum:</p>

<ol><li>In your site's <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>, click <strong><code>Forums</code></strong>. 

<br /><br />
</li><li>At the top, click <strong><code>New Forum</code></strong>. The <code>Forum
Settings</code> screen will open.

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Forum Title" field, type your forum's title. 

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Short Description" field, you can provide a brief
description (limited to 255 characters) that will be displayed along
with the title in the Forums area.

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Description" field, you can enter an in-depth description
of your forum, and provide any associated information or
resources.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Attachments", you can attach a file from your local
computer or from Resources, or specify the address for a file on the
web. For instructions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aupf">Options for adding attachments</a>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>To disable forum postings, under "Forum Posting", check <strong><code>Lock
forum (disable forum postings)</code></strong>.


<br /><br />
</li><li>To moderate forum postings, under "Forum Posting", check
<strong><code>Moderate topics in forum</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>To require students to post before reading others' postings, check
<strong><code>Require users to post before reading</code></strong>.  (Note that
instructions or prompts should go in the short or full description
boxes with this option, since students won't be able to see
conversations initially.)

<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Availability", you can choose to display the forum
immediately or to specify availability dates.

<br /><br />
</li><li>To automatically mark all messages in a conversation as read at
one time, under "Mark All Messages in Conversations Read", check
<strong><code>Automatically mark all messages in a conversation as read</code></strong>.
With this setting, each time you open the first message in a
conversation, all messages within that conversation are automatically
marked as read. The default setting tracks read/unread status for each
message individually. (With the default setting, you can also manually
click <strong><code>Mark All as Read</code></strong> for a given conversation.)

<br /><br />
</li><li>Next to "Gradebook Item", use the drop-down list to choose an item
with which the forum should be associated.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To add an item to the
Gradebook, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aran">Adding, editing, or deleting a Gradebook item</a>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Under "Permissions", you can modify permission levels for participant
roles (and groups, if you've created them; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=atcs">Managing groups</a>).  Click the right arrow next to "Permissions" to
expand the options available.  Next to the role of the participant,
use the <strong><code>Permission Level</code></strong> drop-down list to select from
several predefined permission levels. Additionally, you can create
custom permission levels by clicking the right arrow next to
"Customize" to enable or disable specific functions.</p>
 

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Forum permission settings will apply to all 
subsequently created topics in that forum, but if you modify forum
permission settings after topics have been created, you must change
the topic permission settings separately.</p>


<p>For details, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=atdt">Controlling access in Forums</a>.</p>
</li><li>When you're finished, click one of the following:

<br /><br />

<ul><li><strong><code>Save:</code></strong> Save your changes. 
</li><li><strong><code>Save Settings &amp; Add Topic:</code></strong> Save your changes
and add a topic to your forum. 
</li><li><strong><code>Save Draft:</code></strong> Save your forum as a draft. Forums
saved as draft will not be available to site participants.
</li><li><strong><code>Cancel:</code></strong> Cancel your changes.
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Students will be unable to see or post in your
forum until you add at least one topic.</p>

</li><li>Unless you are creating multiple topics at once (see <a href="#bulk">Automatically creating multiple topics for groups</a>),
under "Automatically Create Topics", leave the default selection
(<strong><code>Create one topic</code></strong>) selected.

<p>Under "Permissions", you can modify permission levels for participant
roles (and groups, if you've created them; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=atcs">Managing groups</a>).  Click the right arrow next to "Permissions" to
expand the options available.  Next to the role of the participant,
use the <strong><code>Permission Level</code></strong> drop-down list to select from
