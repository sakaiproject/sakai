<h2>Controlling access to Forums</h2>














<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this
document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a
basic understanding of roles and permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>In Forums, you can set permissions to control access while you're
creating a new forum or topic (see <a href="content.hlp?docId=asci">Creating a new forum and topic in Forums</a>), or when you're editing an existing forum or topic
(see <a href="content.hlp?docId=atdk">Revising or deleting a forum or topic</a>).</p>


<p>Under "Permissions", you can modify permission levels for
participant roles (and groups, if you've created them; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=atcs">Managing groups</a>). To do so, from the list under
"Permissions", select a role (or group) for editing by clicking its
name. Then, next to "Permission Level:", use the drop-down list to
select from several predefined permission levels. Additionally, you
can create custom permission levels by clicking to enable or disable
the following functions:</p>
 
<ul><li><strong>New Forum:</strong> Create a new forum. You can modify this
option only via Template Settings.
</li><li><strong>New Topic:</strong> Create a new topic. You can modify
this option only via Template Settings or Forum Settings.
</li><li><strong>New Response:</strong> Create a new response to your
topic.
</li><li><strong>Response to Response:</strong> Send responses to a topic
response.
</li><li><strong>Post to Gradebook:</strong> Grade responses and add
comments. Send grades and comments to Gradebook.
</li><li><strong>Change Settings:</strong> Change the topic settings.
</li><li><strong>Read:</strong> Read topic responses.
</li><li><strong>Mark as Read:</strong> Mark messages as read.
</li><li><strong>Moderate Postings:</strong> Moderate messages posted to
forum (available if "Moderate Topics in Forum" option was selected
above).
</li><li><strong>Edit Postings:</strong> Use the radio buttons to
indicate which postings participants with the permission level can
revise (none, their own, or all postings).
</li><li><strong>Delete Postings:</strong> Use the radio buttons to
indicate which postings participants with the permission level can
delete (none, their own, or all postings).

  </li></ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Forum permission settings will apply to all 
subsequently created topics in that forum, but if you modify forum
permission settings after topics have been created, you must change
the topic permission settings separately.</p>
