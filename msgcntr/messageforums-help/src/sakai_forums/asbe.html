<h2>Viewing forums</h2>
<p>To see the list of forums for your site, click
<strong><code>Forums</code></strong> in your site's <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Forums tool is pre-populated with a default
forum and topic.</p>

<p>Each forum appears in an enclosed box with its title and short
description displayed (if created). If a full description of the forum
exists, click <strong><code>View Full Description</code></strong> to view it.</p>
 
<p>Beneath the forum title, topics are listed by title and include a
short description (if created). The following details also appear:</p>
 
<ul><li>A count of total messages
</li><li>A count of unread messages
</li><li>If a topic is moderated, the word "Moderated" will be displayed.
</li><li>If a topic has an attachment, its filename will be
displayed. Click the filename to open the attachment or save it to
your computer.
</li></ul>

<p>Clicking the title of any forum will open an isolated view of a
particular forum and its topics.</p>

<p>Clicking the title of any topic will display conversations (i.e.,
threads of related messages) for that particular topic. If a
conversation has more than one message, use the arrow to the left to
view all messages in that conversation.</p>

<p>To expand all conversations, click <strong><code>Display Message
Content</code></strong>. Click <strong><code>Mark All As Read</code></strong> in any given
conversation to automatically mark all the messages as read; if all
conversations are expanded, <strong><code>Mark All As Read</code></strong> will mark all
messages in the topic as read. You can also manually mark each message as read
by clicking the envelope beside the message. Click a message
to also show how many people have read it.</p>


<p>To open a printable version of the messages, click the printer icon at
the top. A new window will
open; click <strong><code>Send To Printer</code></strong> to print the messages, and then
click <strong><code>Close Window</code></strong> to return to the message screen.</p>


<p>Clicking the title of a conversation will open an isolated view of its
individual messages. Each individual conversation displays a count of total messages and unread messages. Use the <strong><code>View</code></strong> drop-down list to change
the display of messages.</p>


<p>Those with appropriate permissions (e.g., instructors) may see the
content of all posts by a particular participant using the statistics
function; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=avai">Participation statistics</a>.</p>

<p>To open an individual message, click its subject.</p>

<p>In moderated forums, if you have the appropriate permissions to
approve messages, you can see messages awaiting your approval by clicking
<strong><code>Pending Messages</code></strong>; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=avar">Moderating messages in a forum</a>.
If you're not a moderator, you'll see "PENDING" beside a message
awaiting moderation.</p>
