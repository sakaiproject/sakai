<h3>Creating a forum</h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this
document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>. To view a list of permissions
associated with a given role, see 
					[You do not have sufficient permission to view this
					document.]
				. For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and Roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>There are no default forums or topics in the discussion forums area
of the Message Center tool. No forums will appear in this area until
someone with an appropriate role creates them. By default,
participants (e.g., students) in a course site cannot create forums in
Discussion Forums area.</p>

<p>When you create your forum, you'll need to add at least one topic
so site members can post messages.</p>

<p>To create a new discussion forum, follow these steps:</p>

<ol><li>In your site's <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>, click <strong><code>Message
Center</code></strong>. The Message Center screen will open.<br /><br />
</li><li>Next to "Discussion Forums", click <strong><code>New Forum</code></strong>. The
Discussion Forum Settings screen will open.<br /><br />

<a name="3"> </a>
</li><li>In the "Forum Title" field, type your forum's title. This is a
required field, and is limited to 75 characters.<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Short Description" field, you have the option of providing
a brief description (limited to 100 characters) that will be displayed
along with the title in the Discussion Forums area. <br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Description" field, you may enter an in-depth description
of your forum, and provide any associated information or
resources.<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Attachments", you can attach a file from your local
computer or from Resources, or specify the URL for a file on the
web. For instructions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aupf">Options for adding attachments</a>.<br /><br />
</li><li>To disable forum postings, under "Forum Posting", click the
<strong><code>Yes</code></strong> radio button next to "Lock Topic (Disable topic
postings)". The <strong><code>No</code></strong> radio button is selected by default,
allowing site participants to post messages about your forum topic.

participant roles. To do so, from the list under "Permissions", select
a role for editing by clicking its name. Then, next to "Permission
