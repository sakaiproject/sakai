forums=Provides a set of RESTful endpoints for retrieving single fora, site collections of fora , individual topics (collections of conversations) and messages with their children. An example workflow would be to call the site action with /direct/forums/site/SITEID.json for the top level fora in a site, then to use /direct/forums/site/SITEID/forum/FORUMID.json to get an individual forum to the topic level. After that you would use /direct/forums/site/SITEID/forum/FORUMID/topic/TOPICID.json to get a topic, basicallya set of conversations, then you would call /direct/forums/site/SITEID/forum/FORUMID/topic/TOPICID/message/MESSAGEID.json to get a fully populated message with attachments and children.
