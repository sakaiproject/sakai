announcement=Represents announcements for a given site (including merged announcements) or all announcements for a user. Also includes Message Of The Day and public announcements. There are two optional URL parameters available\: 'n' to set the total number of announcements returned, and 'd' to set the number of days in the past to retrieve announcements for. If these parameters are not set, they are retrieved from the tool configuration, or the standard defaults of n\=3 and d\=10 are used. For example /announcements/site/mercury.json?n\=20&amp;d\=100 will retrieve up to 20 total announcements for up to 100 days ago.
