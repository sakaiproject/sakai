<h2>Announcements: Overview</h2>
<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>The Announcements tool is used to inform site participants about
current items of interest. Announcements can have multiple
attachments, such as documents or URLs.</p>


<p>To see the Announcements from all the sites to which you belong, in
the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> of <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My Workspace</a>, click
<strong><code>Announcements</code></strong>.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Sorting:</strong> You can sort announcements by subject,
sender, access, or date.</p>

<p><strong>Posting:</strong> Announcements are posted to a course or
<a href="content.hlp?docId=ardt">project site</a>. Site owners and instructors can choose to have an
announcement automatically sent via email to all site participants by
using the "low" or "high" notification setting.  For more information
on managing email, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aueu">Tools for managing site email</a>.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>Announcements are a useful way to post a notice about an important
change in deadlines, meeting times, or meeting locations. 

<br /><br />
</li><li>When creating an announcement, you can select <strong><code>Show</code></strong> to
make it visible, <strong><code>Hide</code></strong> to hide it, or <strong><code>Specify Dates</code></strong>
to set a beginning date and ending date for the announcement's
visibility.
