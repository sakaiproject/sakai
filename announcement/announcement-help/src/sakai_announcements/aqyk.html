<h2>Announcements: Overview</h2>
<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>The Announcements tool is used to inform site participants about
current items of interest. Announcements can have multiple
attachments, such as documents or web addresses (URLs).</p>


<p>To see the announcements from all the sites to which you belong, in
the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> of <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My Workspace</a>, click
<strong><code>Announcements</code></strong>.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Sorting:</strong> You can sort announcements by subject,
saved by (i.e., the person who last modified the announcement), modified date,
for (i.e., the intended audience), beginning date, or ending date.</p>


<p><strong>Posting:</strong> Announcements are posted to a course,
project, or portfolio site. Site owners and instructors can choose to
have an announcement automatically sent via email to all site
participants by using the "low" or "high" notification setting.  For
more on managing email, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aueu">Tools for managing site communication</a>.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>Announcements are a useful way to post a notice about an important
change in deadlines, meeting times, or meeting locations. 

<br /><br />
</li><li>When creating an announcement, you can select <strong><code>Show</code></strong> to
make it visible, <strong><code>Hide</code></strong> to hide it, or <strong><code>Specify Dates</code></strong>
to set a beginning date and ending date for the announcement's
visibility.

<br /><br />
</li><li>The most recently added or edited announcement will appear
first. To change the order of the announcements, you can either edit
each announcement until they display in the desired listing, or use
the reorder feature. (The
reorder feature may not be available at all institutions; contact your
system administrator for more information.)

</li></ul>
