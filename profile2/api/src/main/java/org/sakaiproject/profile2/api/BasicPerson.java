/**
 * This is the base model for a Person, containing a limited set of fields. It is extended by Person.
 * 
 * <p>Note about serialisation. The User object is not serialisable and does not contain a no-arg constructor
 * so cannot be manually serialised via the serializable methods (readObject, writeObject).</p> 
 * 
 * <p>Hence why it is not used instead. So the most useful values it provides are extracted and set into this object.</p>
