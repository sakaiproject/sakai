# This file specifies the default value for version numbers in the Maven
# build of Sakai.  Changing the value here will change the value of
# sakai.version throughout the Maven build.
# 
# By default sakai.version is used for both the current version of
# each project and the version of the dependencies.  This works well
# for development on the trunk of the source code.  However specific
# projects may want to set these individually.  For example Melete is
# at version 2.0.2, but Sakai itself has no such version so the
# currentVersion value for Melete is set separately from the
# Sakai dependencies.  

sakai.version=dev

# The Sakai plugin changes at a different rate than the rest of Sakai
# so it has it's own version number.

sakai.plugin.version=2.2

# The Springframework version we are using
sakai.spring.version=1.2.6

# The commons-lang version we are using
sakai.commons.lang.version=2.1

# The Hibernate version we are using
sakai.hibernate.groupId=org.hibernate
sakai.hibernate.artifactId=hibernate
sakai.hibernate.version=3.1.3
