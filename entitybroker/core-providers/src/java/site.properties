# this defines the entity description for site
site = Represents a site (a collection of users and tools) in the Sakai system
site.view.new = Adding a site will always set the owner/created by to the current user unless 'owner' is set to a userId, \
the minimum to create a site is the id and the type, all other fields are optional
site.view.list = Retrieves the list of all sites that the current user can access. Supply a value for '_limit' to specify \
how many sites should be returned. Note that there is a system maximum that will override a specified value if it is larger than allowed. \
Supply a value for '_start' to page through results in multiple requests. For example, with 42 sites, requests with '_start' = 1, '_limit' = 50 \
and then '_start' = 51, '_limit' = 50 could be used to retrieve the first batch of 42 sites and the second being empty would signify the end of available results.
site.view.edit = Can update all writeable fields in the site including owner
site.view.show = Allows viewing of data from a single site, use 'includeGroups' (boolean) to also get the groups data with the site
site.view.show.field.includeGroups = use this boolean to also get the groups for this site
site.redirect./{prefix}/{id}/memberships = Allows for retrieval of all memberships for a site by redirecting \
to the memberships entity provider
site.Updateable = The owner (a userId) value can now be changed once the site is created
site.action.exists = Returns an empty 200 if the site exists, and a failure (possibly 404) if it does not. <br/> \
Note that you can also check this by simply using the show view of a site but that returns the site information as well so this is faster
site.field.owner = A userId, can be changed after a site is created but has no real effect if the contact info is set
site.action.group = Allows access to group information directly using a url like: /site/siteId/group/groupId \
For membership actions use the Membership Provider<br /> \
(GET) /direct/site/siteid/group/groupid - gets metadata for group but not membership. <br />\
(POST) /direct/site/siteid/group/groupid - updates metadata for group but not membership. <br />\
(PUT) /direct/site/siteid/group - create a new group in the site (returns group id). Parameters include title, description, optionally initial list of members. <br />\
(DELETE) /direct/site/siteid/group/groupid - delete an existing group in the site.
site.action.userPerms = Allows the retrieval of the current user's permissions within the specified site using a url like \
/site/:SITEID:/userPerms[/:PREFIX], where PREFIX allows the caller to limit the returned permissions to a subset. \
For example, the url '/direct/site/XYZ/userPerms/calendar.json' would return the calendar permissions of the current user in the site 'XYZ'. \
Missing the PREFIX off would result in the permissions for all the tools in the site being returned.
site.action.perms = Allows the retrieval of the permissions for the specified site using a url like \
/site/:SITEID:/perms[/:PREFIX].json, where PREFIX allows the caller to limit the returned permissions to a subset. \
For example, the url '/direct/site/XYZ/perms/calendar.json' would return the calendar permissions for each role in the site 'XYZ'. \
Missing the PREFIX off would result in the permissions for all the tools in the site being returned.
site.action.setPerms = Allows the setting of the permissions for the specified site by posting to the url /site/:SITEID:/setPerms. \
This is done by passing a set of post parameters where the key takes the form of 'ROLEID:FUNCTION' and the value is a boolean 'true' \
or 'false'. For example, passing the parameter 'maintain:blog.post.create=true' would switch the blog.post.create function on for \
the maintain role in the specified site.
site.action.pages = Allows retrieval of all pages and tools in a site, \
use "props" (true/false, default false) to include page properties, \
use "config" (true/false, default false) to include tool configurations
site.action.withPerm=The URL for example, /site/withPerm/.json?permission=site.upd
