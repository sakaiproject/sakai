# this defines the entity description for membership
membership = Represents a user's membership in a location (site, group, etc.) in the system, works with the site/group entities and the user entities. In the documentation below, a membership ID is a string in the form USER_ID::LOCATION_REFERENCE (e.g., "aaronz::site:mySiteId").
membership.view.new = (POST) Add the membership specified by the ID. Alternatively, a POST to the simple "/membership" URL can specify "userId" and "locationReference" request parameters. In either case, optional request parameters are: "memberRole" string (default for joinable site memberships is the default joiner role); "active" Boolean value (default is true). Can do a batch add to the same location using the same role by specifying a "userIds" parameter (an array of user IDs).
membership.view.delete = (DELETE) Delete the membership specified by the ID. Multiple memberships can be deleted from the same location by specifying a "userIds" parameter (an array of user IDs).
membership.view.edit = (POST) Modify the membership specified by the ID. Alternatively, a POST to the "/membership" URL can specify "userId" and "locationReference" request parameters. In either case, optional request parameters are: "memberRole" string; "active" Boolean value. Can do a batch update to the same location using the same role and active setting by specifying a "userIds" parameter (an array of user IDs).
membership.view.list = By default, retrieves a list of all site memberships for the current user. Optional query parameters: "includeSite=false" filters out site memberships; "includeGroup=true" retrieves group memberships; "_locationReference=LOCATION_REFERENCE" returns all memberships in the specified site or group; "user=USER_ID" (or "userId=USER_ID" or "_userReference=USER_REFERENCE") returns the given user's memberships; "role=ROLE_STRING" (or "roleId=ROLE_STRING") restricts the list to the specified member role.
membership.action.site = The URL format is "/membership/site/:SITE_ID:". (GET) will return all memberships in the specified site. (POST) will add one or more site memberships via an array of "userSearchValues" request parameters (each of which is a user ID, user EID, or email address), along with a "memberRole" string (default for joinable site memberships is the default joiner role) and "active" Boolean value (default is true). Response headers may include "x-warning-not-found" (for a list of invalid userSearchValues) and "x-warning-already-members" (for a list of userSearchValues which were already site members).
membership.action.group = Allows for retrieval of all memberships for a group using a url like so: /membership/group/groupId
