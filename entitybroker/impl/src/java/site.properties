# this defines the entity description for site
site = Represents a site (a collection of users and tools) in the Sakai system
site.view.new = Adding a site will always set the owner/created by to the current user, \
the minimum to create a site is the id and the type, all other fields are optional
site.view.list = Retrieves the list of all sites that the current user can access
site.redirect./{prefix}/{id}/memberships = Allows for retrieval of all memberships for a site by redirecting \
to the memberships entity provider
site.Updateable = The owner/createdBy value cannot be changed once the site is created
site.action.exists = Returns an empty 200 if the site exists, and a failure (possibly 404) if it does not. <br/> \
Note that you can also check this by simply using the show view of a site but that returns the site information as well so this is faster
site.field.createdBy = Cannot currently be changed after a site is created
site.field.owner = Cannot currently be changed after a site is created
