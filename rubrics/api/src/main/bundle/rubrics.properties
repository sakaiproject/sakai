public_rubrics_info=Rubrics in this section were created by instructors and shared publicly with all users. You can share a rubric publicly by clicking on the "Globe" icon next to the rubric you would like to share. To use one of these rubrics in your course site, expand the "Public Rubrics" section and click on the "Copy" icon located in the "Actions" column.
grading_404_info=If you can see a GET error above this message, for the returned evaluation, \
please ignore it as it is expected. Rubrics probes for a potentially non-existent returned \
evaluation copy and handles the 404. However, some browsers also print an error about the \
missing resource, and there's not much we can do about that, currently.
