# Sakai Webcomponents rules

Sakai Webcomponents use LIT

Lint rules are available in webcomponents/tool/src/main/frontend/eslint.config.mjs

Lint rules include no trailing spaces. Use double quotes instead of single quotes.

Webcomponents are internationalized. Never use an OR switch to also provide english text. Just use the i18n property only.

Sakai has a portal object that includes the user's preferred timezone and preferred lang/locale. Do not attempt to manipulate dates and times based on the browser's timezone.

When defining Lit component state that should remain internal (non-reflected), prefix the property name with an underscore (for example `_points`) and expose getters if external read access is required. This keeps the surface area clear until native `#` private fields are available everywhere. Lit properties defined with `{ state: true }` already avoid attribute reflection, so prefer reacting through declarative template bindings instead of reaching into the DOM imperatively.
