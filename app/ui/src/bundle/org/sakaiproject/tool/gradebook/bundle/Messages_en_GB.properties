# There's an interesting and buggy behavior in java resource bundles.  When the
# MessageFormat api is used to replace placeholders with strings (e.g. Assignment
# {0} has been deleted.), the single quote character must be "escaped" by doubling
# the single quote.
#
# So, in the following message:
#
# "You have successfully updated assignment {0}. Scores have been entered
# previously for this assignment. Pre-existing scores will not be adjusted if the
# assignment's point value has changed."
#
# you must use two single quotes like so:
# "... the assignment''s point value has changed."
#
# When not using the MessageFormat api (when no placeholders are needed), the
# single quote works, and two single quotes are displayed as -- you guessed it --
# two single quotes.
#
# More details of this bug are available here:
