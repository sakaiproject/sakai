user=Represents a user in the system, user data is effectively immutable and removing users cannot override externally provided users
user.view.list=Gets a list of all users in the system (can be limited by search but always max of 50 results), normally this only works for admin users, but can be enabled for all users with config setting 'entity.users.viewall\=true'
user.view.show=Get a single user by eid (default) or id by prefixing it with "id\=" (e.g. /user/id\=ERW434YIY88)
user.view.new=Creates a user, eid is the only required field, all others are optional, id may be specified as well but one will be generated for you if you leave this out
user.Resolvable=The user identifier by default is the eid (e.g. /user/aaronz), lookups can also happen using the id by prefixing it with "id\=" (e.g. /user/id\=ERW434YIY88)
user.action.current=Get the current user if there is one
