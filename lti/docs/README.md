Deprecated Documentation
------------------------

* [Sakai API Documentation Including Legacy API Extensions](sakai_lti_api.md)
Sakai has API extensions for Membership/Roster, Learning Object Repository Integration, and a Settings service.
* [Configuring the Sakai LTI 1.1 Provider](sakai_lti_provider)
This has not been tested since before Sakai 20 so it should not be considered current.
* [Installing Sakai tools in an LMS Using LTI ContentItem](CONTENTITEM.md)
Since the inline portal was rolled out back in 2015, tools have slowly lost the ability to run inside
iframes and the move to the Trinity portal in Sakai 23 pretty much broke the feature completely - this should
not be used without significant new work.
* [Documentation for Vendors of Sakai Tools](sakai_lti_vendor.md)
This was LTI 1.1 only and for LTI 1.3 this step is accomplished using the LTI External Tools Admin or
LTI Dynamic Registration through the Sakai Admin UI.
* [Configuring the Sakai External Tools Portlet](sakai_lti_portlet.md)
This was LTI 1.1 only and for LTI 1.3 this step is accomplished using the LTI External Tools Admin or
LTI Dynamic Registration through the Sakai Admin UI.
