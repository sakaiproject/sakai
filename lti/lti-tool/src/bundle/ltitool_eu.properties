tool.new.insert.start.text.admin=This screen starts the process of inserting a new LTI tool. A draft version of the tool will be created from this page, and you will be allowed to continue to add the necessary data to complete the tool installation on the following screen. Once this screen is completed, you will be allowed to use LTI Dynamic Registration on the following screen.

tool.new.insert.start.siteId=Site Id (Normally Left Blank)
tool.new.insert.start.siteId.description=If you enter a Site Id into the field above, you are creating a tool that is "owned" by that site and it cannot be used in any other site.  If you want to create a tool and make it available in one or more sites, stealth the tool and manually deploy it to the selected sites in the following screen.  Manual deployment is more flexible in that the tool can be added to or removed from any number of sites.  In the past, it was a common practice to add multiple copies of an LTI 1.1 tool in one or more sites as a way of making the tool available in only a few sites.  This still works for LTI 1.1 tools, but is problematic for LTI 1.3 tools as each site scoped tool requires a different tenant from the tool vendor.<br><br> The best practice for making tools available to a limited set of sites is to leave the site id blank on this form and using manual deployment on the next screen to limit access to the tool.  Using manual deployment works equivalently for LTI 1.1 and LTI 1.3 tools and only requires one tenant from the tool vendor.<br><br>Manual deployment in effect improves on the "stealth" feature where a tool could be installed globally (site id is blank) and then hand-inserted by the Sakai administrator into a few sites.

tool.lti13.auto.start.text=Some LTI Advantage Tools support a dynamic registration standard.  This is not the same as a launch URL.  If you have a URL, we will insert a new tool and then use dynamic registration to fill in data for the tool.  After the tool has been registered - you can review the values and either save the tool to activate it or delete the draft tool.  This process may require you to present credentials to the tool.  Provisioning URLs from some tools can only be used once so check with your tool vendor as to how to register their tool.
