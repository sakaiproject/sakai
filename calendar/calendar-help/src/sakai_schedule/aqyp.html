<h2>Changing your Calendar view</h2>
<p>In Schedule, you can view your
calendar by day, week, month, or year. To change your view, use the
"View" drop-down list to select <strong><code>Calendar by Day</code></strong>, <strong><code>Calendar
by Week</code></strong>, <strong><code>Calendar by Month</code></strong>, or <strong><code>Calendar by
Year</code></strong>. To view all of your scheduled activities in a list, select
<strong><code>List of Events</code></strong>.</p>

<p>When viewed by day or week, the calendar will display a time range
of 10 hours. To adjust the range so that it displays hours that are
earlier or later in the day, click the links at the top (earlier) or
bottom (later) of the calendar.</p>

<p>When viewing your activities as a list (by clicking <strong><code>List of
Events</code></strong>), you can change which events are displayed by using the
"Show" drop-down list. Choose <strong><code>All events</code></strong>, <strong><code>Events for
today</code></strong>, <strong><code>Events for this week</code></strong>, <strong><code>Events for this
month</code></strong>, or <strong><code>Events for this year</code></strong>. To set a custom date
range, select <strong><code>Custom date range</code></strong>, use the "Start" and "End"
fields to set the appropriate range, and then click <strong><code>Filter
Events</code></strong>.</p>
