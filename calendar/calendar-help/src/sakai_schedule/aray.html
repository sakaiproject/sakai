<h2>Schedule: Overview</h2>














<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>Schedule allows instructors or site organizers to post items in a
calendar format. The calendar has day, week, month, year, and flat
list views.</p>

<p>Many instructors use Schedule to post readings for each class on the
day they are due to be read.</p>

<p>Research, group, and department projects often use Schedule to post
group deadlines.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Activity list:</strong> To see a list of all events, next to
"View", click <strong><code>List of Events</code></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Merging calendars:</strong> All calendars on sites you have
access to are merged in your My Workspace Schedule. In worksites, you
can click <strong><code>Merge</code></strong> to selectively merge calendars from other
sites to which you have access.</p>


<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>A Schedule overview appears on the <strong><code>Home</code></strong> tool for
individual worksites. For more information, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=avaz">Schedule summary</a>.
</li><li>Any Schedule item can have multiple attachments.

<br /><br />
</li><li>You can print an Adobe PDF file of any view of a
Schedule by clicking <strong><code>Printable Version</code></strong> while in the desired
view. This will open a PDF file in a new browser window.
