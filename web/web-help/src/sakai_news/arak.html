<h2>Viewing a news feed</h2>
<p>If your site has a link to a news feed, it will appear in the site's
<a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>. Depending on how the site owner has set up the feed,
you may see <strong><code>News</code></strong> in the menubar, or a more descriptive title,
such as <strong><code>New York Times</code></strong>, <strong><code>CNN</code></strong>, or <strong><code>Yahoo!  News</code></strong>.</p>

<p>The News tool in a site is an RSS "news
aggregator" (or newsreader) that reads and displays continuously
updated online content from RSS news feeds. </p>

<p>In addition to news, some web sites use the RSS format for information
that is updated often, such as blogs, events listings, or
the revision history of a book. You can usually identify an RSS feed
URL by the <code>.xml</code> or <code>.rss</code> in the URL (e.g.,
http://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Movies.xml
or http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss). You
can also search the web for RSS feeds pertaining to a certain interest
or publication.</p>

<p>To add a web address for an RSS feed to your site (if you have the necessary
permissions), see <a href="content.hlp?docId=areh">Adding, editing, or deleting a news feed</a>.</p>
