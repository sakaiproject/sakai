<h2>Viewing a news feed</h2>
<p>If your site has a link to a news feed, you will find it in the site's
<a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>. To view news, simply click the title of the news
feed from the menubar. The title will vary, depending on what the
site owner has chosen for your site's news feed. You may see
<strong><code>News</code></strong> in the menubar, or something more descriptive, e.g.,
<strong><code>New York Times</code></strong>, <strong><code>CNN</code></strong>, or <strong><code>Yahoo! News</code></strong>.</p>

<p>The News tool in a course or project site is an RSS "news
aggregator" (or newsreader) that reads and displays continuously
updated online content from RSS news feeds. RSS is an application of
XML, a markup language for creating web documents.</p>

<p>In addition to news, some web sites use the RSS format for information
that is updated often, such as blogs (web logs that serve as publicly
accessible personal journals), events listings, or the revision
history of a book. You can usually identify an RSS feed URL by the
<code>.xml</code> or <code>.rss</code> in the URL (e.g.,
http://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Movies.xml
or http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss).</p>

<p>If you have the necessary permissions, you can customize your course
or project site's News feature by adding a web address for any RSS
news feed. You can find many feeds by searching Google for RSS feeds
in your area of interest or for a particular online publication or
news source.</p>
