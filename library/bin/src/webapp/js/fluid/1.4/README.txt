What Is Infusion?
=================
Infusion is a different kind of JavaScript framework. Our approach is to leave you in control-- 
it's your interface, using your markup, your way. Infusion is accessible and very, very configurable.

Infusion includes:
    * an application framework for developing flexible stuff with JavaScript and jQuery
    * a collection of accessible UI components
    * a lightweight CSS framework
