 * Configuration file for the File Manager Connector for Python
"""

# INSTALLATION NOTE: You must set up your server environment accordingly to run
# python scripts. This connector requires Python 2.4 or greater.
#
# Supported operation modes:
#  * WSGI (recommended): You'll need apache + mod_python + modpython_gateway
#                        or any web server capable of the WSGI python standard
#  * Plain Old CGI:      Any server capable of running standard python scripts
#                        (although mod_python is recommended for performance)
#                        This was the previous connector version operation mode
#
# If you're using Apache web server, replace the htaccess.txt to to .htaccess,
# and set the proper options and paths.
# For WSGI and mod_python, you may need to download modpython_gateway from:
# http://projects.amor.org/misc/svn/modpython_gateway.py and copy it in this
# directory.


# SECURITY: You must explicitly enable this "connector". (Set it to "True").
# WARNING: don't just set "ConfigIsEnabled = True", you must be sure that only
#		authenticated users can access this file or use some kind of session checking.

# user files directory. Useful if you are using a virtual directory, symbolic
# link or alias. Examples: 'C:\\MySite\\userfiles\\' or '/root/mysite/userfiles/'.
# Attention: The above 'UserFilesPath' must point to the same directory.
# WARNING: GetRootPath may not work in virtual or mod_python configurations, and
# may not be thread safe. Use this configuration parameter instead.

# so that it was possible to access it at the later time.

# Set to 0 to disable this feature.

#	Configuration settings for each Resource Type
#
#	- AllowedExtensions: the possible extensions that can be allowed.
#		If it is empty then any file type can be uploaded.
#	- DeniedExtensions: The extensions that won't be allowed.
#		If it is empty then no restrictions are done here.
#
#	For a file to be uploaded it has to fulfill both the AllowedExtensions
#	and DeniedExtensions (that's it: not being denied) conditions.
#
#	- FileTypesPath: the virtual folder relative to the document root where
#		these resources will be located.
#		Attention: It must start and end with a slash: '/'
#
#	- FileTypesAbsolutePath: the physical path to the above folder. It must be
#		an absolute path.
#		If it's an empty string then it will be autocalculated.
#		Useful if you are using a virtual directory, symbolic link or alias.
#		Examples: 'C:\\MySite\\userfiles\\' or '/root/mysite/userfiles/'.
#		Attention: The above 'FileTypesPath' must point to the same directory.
#		Attention: It must end with a slash: '/'
#
#
#	- QuickUploadPath: the virtual folder relative to the document root where
#		these resources will be uploaded using the Upload tab in the resources
#		dialogs.
#		Attention: It must start and end with a slash: '/'
#
#	- QuickUploadAbsolutePath: the physical path to the above folder. It must be
#		an absolute path.
