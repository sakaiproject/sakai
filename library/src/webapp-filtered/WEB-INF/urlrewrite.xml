        <note>This is so that if someone upgrades ckeditor the old URLs in content continue to work. While the
        versions are the same the redirect is needless. This is because some early versions of Sakai 11.x have content
        with the 4.5.7 version in it. This could have been done with a wildcard from but then we could never have
        switched the filter back to use the FORWARD dispatcher.</note>

        <note>Some images (smiley) end up in the HTML content. This means if the version of ckeditor moves URLs
        we need to redirect the old URLs to the new ones.</note>
