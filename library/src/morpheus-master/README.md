# Morpheus for Sakai

Morpheus (Mobile Optimized Responsive Portal for Higher Education Using Sass) is the new responsive design portal (the primary UI) which will be available in Sakai 11 (and is in a preview state for Sakai 10). The neo portal is the portal which was developed and released for Sakai 2.9. Before that the portal was known as the Charon portal.
