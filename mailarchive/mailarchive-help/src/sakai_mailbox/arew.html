<h2>Sending and receiving mail using Email
Archive</h2>
<p>The Email Archive gives your site its own email address. All email messages sent to your site's email address are stored in the Email Archive and can be automatically forwarded to all site members. Site owners
can choose to add the tool, if it is not present by default, and to
customize the address to make it easier to remember; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardl">Adding Email Archive to your site</a>.</p>


<h3>Sending email messages</h3>

<p>To send mail to the Email Archive:</p>

<ol><li>If you don't already know the email address for the site, in the
<a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> of your site, click <strong><code>Email Archive</code></strong>.

<p>On the Email Archive screen, under "Email sent to the following
addresses will be archived and sent to participants", you'll see the
site email address. </p>

<p>Above the site address, you'll see a message telling you if you are
authorized to send email. If this site is set up to accept mail only
from site participants (see <a href="content.hlp?docId=ares">Customizing an Email Archive</a>),
you will also see the address from which you are authorized to send
email; use this account to send messages to the site address. </p>
</li><li>Send email to your site's Email Archive address from your email
account, just as you would to any other email address. 
</li></ol>


<p><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot use Email Archive to send mail to
particular individuals. To send messages to individual
participants or a group, use the Messages tool; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=augw">Sending, forwarding, and replying to messages</a>.</p>


<h3>Receiving email messages</h3> 

 



<p>Email Archive messages are sent to the email address listed under
"Account" in My Workspace. You do not need to log into  Sakai to read your
mail. However, if you do not wish to receive mail from the site, or if
you'd rather receive mail in a daily digest format, you can change
your notification preferences from <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My Workspace</a>. For
instructions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzv">Changing notification preferences</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Site owners can choose to prevent Email Archive mail from being sent to site participants. For more, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=ares">Customizing an Email Archive</a>.</p>
