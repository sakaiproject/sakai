<h2>Sending mail to site
    participants via Email Archive</h2>
<p>To send email to every member of your course or <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardt">project
site</a>:</p>

<ol><li>In the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> of your course or project site, click
<strong><code>Email Archive</code></strong>. If you don't see Email Archive, the site
leader (or someone with the proper permissions) must add it to the
site; for instructions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardl">Adding Email Archive to your site</a>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>On the Email Archive screen, under "Email sent to the following
addresses will be archived and sent to participants", you'll see the
site email address. Above it, you'll see a message telling you if you
are authorized to send email. If this site is set up to accept
mail only from site participants (see <a href="content.hlp?docId=ares">Customizing an Email Archive</a>), you will also see the address from which you are
authorized to send email; use this account to send messages to the
site address. Messages will go to <strong>all</strong> participants in
your course or project site, and will be archived online in the Email
Archive.
</li></ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot use Email Archive to send
mail to particular individuals. Mail sent to your site's email
address is received by all site participants. To send messages to
individual participants, use the Messages tool.</p>
