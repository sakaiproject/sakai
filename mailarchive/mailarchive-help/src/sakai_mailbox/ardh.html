<h2>Email Archive: Overview</h2>
<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>Each site has an automatically generated site email address, which you
can view via the Email Archive tool. Email you send to the site email
address is copied to the email addresses of all site participants and
owners.</p>

<p>All email messages sent to your site's email address are stored in the
Email Archive. Each message sent to site participants will indicate if
there is an attachment, and provide a link to get the attachment from
the worksite itself.</p>

<p>Site members can use <strong><code>Preferences</code></strong> in <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My Workspace</a>
to choose how often they want to receive email sent to the site's
email address; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzv">Changing notification preferences</a>.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Mail Alias:</strong> Site owners can create an
easy-to-remember alias for the site's email address. To set up the
alias, from within the Email Archive, click <strong><code>Options</code></strong>.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>
<ul><li>Use Email Archive to mail all site participants at once. You
cannot use it to send mail to an individual or a group within the
site. To send messages to an individual or a group, use the Messages
tool instead; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=augw">Sending, forwarding, and replying to messages</a>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>You can choose to receive email either as it is sent, or in digest
mode, with all posts for the day sent in a single email message.
<br /><br />
</li><li>You can use any email program to send mail to the
email address listed at the top of your Email Archive page.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Clicking a column header (<strong><code>From</code></strong>, <strong><code>Subject</code></strong>, or
<strong><code>Date Received</code></strong>) will sort the email messages by that header.

<br /><br />
</li><li>When sorting by subject, clicking the up arrow will arrange the
email messages alphabetically. When sorting by date received, clicking the
up arrow will order the messages from most recent to oldest. In both
cases, clicking the down arrow reverses the order.  <br /><br />
</li><li>The Email Archive uses plain text to format email messages, even if
their original format was HTML or rich text. You can view a
message in its original format by clicking the link provided in the
Email Archive.  <br /><br />
</li><li>The Email Archive uses links to handle attachments. Instead of
receiving an attachment directly in the body of an email message, you
can click a link to view the attachment. This feature helps prevent
you from going over quota.</li></ul>
