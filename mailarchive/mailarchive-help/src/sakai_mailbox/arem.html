<h2>Sending and receiving email using Email
Archive</h2>
<p>The Email Archive gives your <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardt">course site</a> or <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardt">project
site</a> its own email address that participants can use for
communicating with each other. When you first access the site, if you
do not see the <strong><code>Email Archive</code></strong> tool on the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>,
you will need to add it. See <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardl">Adding Email Archive to your site</a>.</p>



<h3>Sending email messages</h3>

<p>You can send email to your site's participants from your email
account with your preferred email client (e.g.,
Outlook, Outlook Express, Eudora,
Mac OS X Mail, or Thunderbird). All email messages
will be stored in the Email Archive and visible to all
participants. To view your site's email address, in the menubar, click
<strong><code>Email Archive</code></strong>. For more, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arew">Sending mail to site participants via Email Archive</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Email sent to the site's email address
will go to all participants (i.e., you can't send email to individual
participants using Email Archive). To send messages to individuals,
use the Messages tool; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=augw">Sending, forwarding, and replying to messages</a>.</p>

<h3>Receiving email messages</h3> 

<p>Email Archive messages are sent to the email address listed under
"Account" in the My Workspace area. You do not need to log into the
application to read your mail. However, if you do not wish to receive
mail from the site, or if you'd rather receive mail in a daily digest
format, you can change your notification preferences from <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My
Workspace</a>. For instructions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzv">Changing notification preferences</a>.</p>
