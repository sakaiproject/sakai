YAHOO Global Namespace - Release Notes

0.11.4

   * Changed window.YAHOO = window.YAHOO || {} to 
     if (typeof YAHOO == "undefined") YAHOO = {} because the previous statement
     contributed to a memory leak when the library was hosted in an iframe.

0.11.3

   * Changed var YAHOO = window.YAHOO || {} to window.YAHOO = window.YAHOO || {}.
     This fixes an issue in IE where YAHOO would get overwritten if previously
     defined via array notation (window["YAHOO"]).

0.11.0

   * Added YAHOO.extend, which provides an easy way to assign the prototype,
     constructor, and superclass properties inheritance properties.  It also
     prevents the constructor of the superclass from being exectuted twice.

0.10.0

   * Added YAHOO.log that provides a safe way to plumb logging statements in
     code that will work if the logging component isn't available.
