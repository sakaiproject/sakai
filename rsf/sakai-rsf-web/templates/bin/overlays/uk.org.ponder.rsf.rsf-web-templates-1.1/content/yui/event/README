YUI Library - Event - Release Notes

0.11.4

   * Fixed a memory leak that occured when the utility was hosted in an iframe.

   * Fixed an issue with Safari click listeners when listeners were removed.

0.11.3

   * The listener cache is now pruned when events are removed.  This fixes
     a performance issue when adding many listeners, removing them, and
     adding them again repeatedly.

   * Safari click listeners will work correctly if a bound element is removed
     from the DOM and a new element with the same ID is added.

   * Removed the code that automatically unsubscribed custom event listeners.

0.11.0

   * Added Event.purgeElement which will remove all listeners added via
     addListener from the supplied element.  If an optional "type" parameter
     is supplied, only events of that type will be removed.  Optionally, the
     purge can be performed recursively on the element's children as well.

   * Added Event.getListeners which will return all listeners attached to
     a given element.. either all listeners or listeners of a specific type.

   * getTarget now automatically resolves text nodes.  The optional parameter
     for this feature is now deprecated.

   * getRelatedTarget now resolves text nodes for the browsers that return the
     text node rather than its host HTML element.

   * CustomEvent now logs the custom event activity if the logger widget is
   available

0.10.0

   * Added Safari dblclick to the list of legacy events.

   * When multiple identical event handlers are defined, multiple calls
     to removeListener can now remove all of them.

   * removeListener works properly for unload events

   * Legacy event bookkeeping is more efficient, improving the performance for
     adding Safari click events.

   * _unload() is more efficient, improving the page transition experience in
     Safari in particular.

   * addListener, removeListener now return false if the function argument is
     not valid.

   * Fixed an operator precedence issue in getCharCode.

   * Added Event.getXY, which returns [Event.getPageX(e), Event.getPageY(e)]

   * Added Event.onAvailable, which will execute the callback when the element
     with the supplied id is found.  Currently searches periodically until the
     window load event or for up to 10 seconds after the onAvailable method
     was executed.

   * The lazy listener attachment process now will poll beyond the window load
     event in order to better handle the case when a listener is defined
     late in the page but before the element is in the dom.

   * Fixed browser detection for Opera installations reporting as IE.

   * It is now possible to remove and re-add legacy events (Safari click event).
