/**
 * The equivalent of {@link EntityViewParamsInferrer} for the {@link EntityView}
 * system supported in versions 1.3 of the EntityBroker and above. Allows a
 * developer to define the default view and view params associated with a
 * particular entity view. this is the tie in to the
 * {@link org.sakaiproject.entitybroker.EntityBroker} in Sakai<br/>
 * This will be called whenever an entity URL is accessed which starts with the
 * prefix returned by the handled prefix method<br/>
 * <br/>
 * Best practices usage:<br/>
 * 1) Implement this interface in your tool<br/>
 * 2) Add this as a spring bean to your applicationContext.xml in your tool<br/>
 * Example:
 * <xmp> <bean class="org.sakaiproject.sample.tool.inferrers.SampleVPInferrer">
 * <property name="externalLogic" ref=
 * "org.sakaiproject.sample.logic.ExternalLogic" /> </bean> </xmp> 3) Add in the
 * extra spring config files to web.xml if they are not already there:<br/>
 * contextConfigLocation should have:<br/>
 * classpath:conf/sakai-entitybroker-applicationContext.xml,
 * classpath:conf/sakai-entitybroker-13-applicationContext.xml<br/>
 * requestContextConfigLocation<br/>
 * classpath:conf/sakai-entitybroker-requestContext.xml,
 * classpath:conf/sakai-entitybroker-13-requestContext.xml<br/>
