= Sakai REST API

**__Before you can use any of the apis, you need to login__**

=== Login API

Logging in with the login API will return the session id to you if successful. It will also set a
session cookie containing that session id, and that cookie can be supplied in all subsequent
requests to any Sakai api calls. So, if you were making a sequence of api calls, you would typically
call login with curl, storing the cookie in a jar file, then you would just use that jar file for
the remainder of the api calls.

The login HTTP request:

Now get your calendar (you will need to add your cookie jar file to this cUrl command with the -b option):
