<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete these procedures, you must be
assigned a role having the necessary permissions.  To determine your
role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>For any site you create, you can import
instructor-generated content (e.g., announcements, assignments, tool
settings) from one or more other sites you own. Submitted material,
such as completed assignments, forum postings, or grades, cannot be
imported using the following methods; you must download and save such
material manually.</p>

<h3>Importing material from another site</h3>

<p>To import material from another site:</p>

<ol><li>In the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> of the destination site, click <strong><code>Site Info</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>At the top of the screen, click <strong><code>Import from Site</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>On the <code>Import Data</code> screen,
choose one of the following: <br /><br />

<ul><li><strong><code>I would like to replace my data</code></strong>: Use this option to
overwrite the existing data with the imported data.  This method lets
you select only one source site from which to import data.
</li><li><strong><code>I would like to merge my data</code></strong>: Use this option to merge the 
imported data with the existing data.  This method
lets you select multiple sites from which to import data.
</li><li><strong><code>I would like to merge my user(s)</code></strong>: Use this option
if you want to import the participant roster from another site. This
method does not import users provided by an automatic roster feed.
 </li></ul><br />
</li><li>Select the source site(s), and then click <strong><code>Continue</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>If applicable, under the name of the site(s) you selected, check
the box next to each tool that contains source material you want to
import. If a box is grayed out, it means the corresponding tool is not
enabled in that site. Then, click <strong><code>Finish</code></strong>.
</li></ol>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul><li>Items saved as drafts in the source site will be imported as
drafts, which means they are not immediately viewable by
participants. To make them viewable, you must post them. For
instructions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbk">Posting an assignment previously saved as a draft</a>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>When assignments are imported from
another site, the <strong><code>Add to Gradebook</code></strong> option is selected by
default.  If such an assignment is then updated and saved, a
corresponding Gradebook entry will be created, which may or may not be
what was intended.  To associate the item to an existing Gradebook
entry, rather than creating a new Gradebook item from within the
Assignments tool, select <strong><code>Associate with existing Gradebook
entry</code></strong>, and then choose the desired Gradebook entry before
posting.  For more on the differences between the two options, see
<a href="content.hlp?docId=avnd">Linking an assignment to the Gradebook</a>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>When you import Gradebook settings, it may be possible to import
an item with a Gradebook Item Point Value less than or equal to 0
(zero); however, if you try to edit such an item, you will receive an
error message.

</li></ul>
