<h2>Importing material from another site you
own</h2>




 

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this
document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a
basic understanding of roles and permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>For any course or <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardt">project site</a> you create, you can import
content from other sites you own. You can also combine material from
more than one site. To do so, follow these steps:</p>

<ol><li>In the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> of the destination site, click <strong><code>Site Info</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>At the top of the Site
Info screen, click <strong><code>Import from Site</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Check the box next to the site that contains the source
material. You may choose more than one site. Then click
<strong><code>Continue</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Under the name of the site(s) you selected, check the box next to
each tool that contains your source material. If a box is grayed out,
it means the corresponding tool is not available in that site. Then
click <strong><code>Continue</code></strong>.
</li></ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Your newly imported materials are initially
saved as drafts, which means they are not immediately viewable by
participants. To make them viewable, you must post them. For
instructions, see:</p>

<ul><li><a href="content.hlp?docId=arbk">Posting an assignment previously saved as a draft</a></li><li><a href="content.hlp?docId=arbw">Posting an announcement previously saved as a draft</a></li><li><a href="content.hlp?docId=arau">Posting a discussion topic or reply previously saved as a draft</a></li></ul>
