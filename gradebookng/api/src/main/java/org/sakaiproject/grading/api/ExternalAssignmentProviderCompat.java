/**
 * Provider extension to integrate external assessment sources with the gradebook.
 * This is an extension of ExternalAssignmentProvider, only here for backward
 * compatibility of the 2.9 API. The reason it is added is to support tools
 * that participate in the gradebook but have not implemented the provider.
 * Before this was implemented, external items for tools without a provider
 * could never be visible in the student view of the gradebook.
 *
 * This interface should be merged into ExternalAssignmentProvider for the next
 * major release.
 *
 * See also: https://jira.sakaiproject.org/browse/SAK-23733
