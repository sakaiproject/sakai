wiki_help_page=h1 How to format your Wiki pages\nWiki pages may be formatted using codes given below. These codes provide simple text styles such as __bold__, ~~italic~~ and lists.\n\nThere are also a number of 'macros' which can automatically provide certain information, as well as being used for more complex tasks, such as including tables, images and attachments.\n\n(The Wiki language used is based on {link:Radeox|http://radeox.org}).\n\nh1 Formatting short-cut icons\nYou can insert common formatting commands using the links in the toolbar at the top of the wiki page editor. These links include bold, italic, headings, tables, uploading attachments and including images.\n\nh3 Simple text formatting\n\n{table}\nType these codes| Displays as | Descriptions\n\\_\\_bold\\_\\_ | __bold__ | simple bold text\n\\~\\~italics\\~\\~ | ~~italics~~ | simple italic text\n\\-\\-strike\\-\\- | --strike-- | strike through text\nCH\\%\\%4\\%\\%|CH%%4%%| subscript (for more mathematical formatting, see below)\nCa\\^\\^2+\\^\\^| Ca^^2+^^| superscript \n\\[my new page\\] | [my new page] | links to a new Wiki page with the name given in brackets\n\\http://www.bbc.co.uk/ | http://www.bbc.co.uk/ | creates an automatic link to an external website or an online document. \nh1 Title || a major headline (displayed as <H1> would be in the local CSS styling)\nh3 Title || a minor headline (displayed as <H3> would be in the local CSS styling)\n\\{bgcolor:yellow\\}Some text\\{bgcolor\\}|{bgcolor:yellow}Highlighted text{bgcolor}|Highlights the text between the brackets (note US spelling!)\n\\{color:red\\}Some text\\{color\\}|{color:red}Red text {color}|Changes the colour of the text between the brackets (note US spelling!)\n\\-\\-\\-\\- || display a horizontal line across the page\n- list item|| create a bulleted list \n* list item|| create a bulleted list which is displayed slightly differently from the one above\n# list item|| create an automatically numbered list\na. list item|| create an automatically alphabetical list\nA. list item|| uppercase alphabetical list\ni. list item|| lowercase Roman numerical list\nI. list item|| uppercase Roman numerical list\ng., h., k., j. list item|| Greek, Hiragana, Katakana & Hebrew numerical lists\n(empty line) || divides text into paragraphs\n\\\\\\ || creates extra space between paragraphs\n\\\\\\\\X | X | display the special character "X" (for example, \\\\\\\\{ will display {)\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ | \\\\\\\\ | display a \\\\\\\\ \n{table} \n\nh3 Macros and More \nFor a full list of macros and parameters, type \\{list-of-macros\\} in any page. This list gives an introduction to the most useful.\n\n__Add an email link__\n\n{mailto:} followed by an email address will create an email link in the page.\n\ne.g. \\{mailto:pbehr@cam.ac.uk\\} will display as {mailto:pbehr@cam.ac.uk}\n\n__Create an automatic index for your Wiki__\t\n\nTyping \\{index\\} will create an automatically updated index of pages for your Wiki. \n\n(No example as it takes up a lot of space!)\n\n__Create an automatic list of recently changed pages__\n\nTyping \\{recent-changes\\} will create an automatically updated list of the recently changed pages in your Wiki, together with the name of the person who last changed the page and the date and time of the change. By default, it shows all the pages changed in the last 30 days.\n\n*  \\{recent-changes:12h\\} - recently changed pages in the last 12 hours.\n*  \\{recent-changes:7d\\} - recently changed pages in the last 7 days.\n*  \\{recent-changes:2006-12-25\\} - recently changed pages since 25 Dec, 2006.\n\n(No example as it takes up a lot of space!)\n\n\n__Add an image to your page__\n\nTyping \\{image:\\} and including the URL of the image will display an image on your page. (This is just the same as clicking the image icon in the edit screen, which is easier to use.)\n\n\\{image:/images/bear.jpg|A Bear\\} would show the image whose relative URL was "/images/bear.jpg". The alternative text shown would be "A Bear".\n\nTo float your image left, so that text flows round it, include the extra text "|ext|float-left", as below:\n\n\\{image:/images/bear.jpg|A Bear|ext|float-left\\} \n\nTo float your image right, so that text flows round it, include the extra text "|ext|float-right", as below:\n\n\\{image:/images/bear.jpg|A Bear|ext|float-right\\} \n\n\nThe image URL may be relative or absolute but cannot be external. The URL may also start with "worksite:/" to display images from this worksite. To display images from your other worksites, you may start a URL with "sakai:/" and include the site ID.\n\n__Create an anchor tag__\n\nTyping \\{anchor\\} creates an HTML anchor tag around the text it contains.\t\n\ne.g. \\{anchor:myLink\\}Jump to this point \\{anchor\\}\n\nThe link to jump to that point should appear as follows:\n\n\\[Go to this exciting point|Name of current page here#myLink\\]\n\n__Using mathematical formatting__\n\nRWiki uses JS Math so that you can display maths entered in TeX form. \n\nTyping \\{math:display\\} \\{math\\} will display TeX between the two tags.\t\n\ne.g. \\{math:display\\}U_n+2\\} U_n+1\\} U_n \\{math\\} \n{math:display}U_n+2} U_n+1} U_n {math} \n\nFind out more {link:here|http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/welcome.html|none|_new}\n\n__Display a quotation__\n\nTo display a quotation, type \\{quote\\} on either side of the text you want to display as a quote.\n\n{quote}Like this!{quote}\n\n\n\nh3 Sakai related macros\n\n__\\{sakai-sections\\}__\tGenerate a list of links that points to subsites that are automatically generated for each section in your worksite. Note that there is no interface within the wiki to manage permissions on a section by section level.\n\n__\\{worksiteinfo\\}__ Lists the information about the current site\t\n

wiki_home_page=h1 Welcome to the Wiki Tool\n\nh3 What is a wiki?\n\nA wiki is a tool which allows people to create web pages individually or as a group, without needing any web skills.\n\nUsing the wiki tool, you can create and edit web pages within your worksite. If you wish, you can make all or some pages publicly viewable.\n\nh3 Using wikis for teaching\nThere are a wide number of ways to use wikis for teaching - a web search will find any number of suggestions and case studies. For example, students can develop a collection of resources about the topic they are studying, and make them available to the outside world. Other lecturers like to produce a wiki page as a way of publishing lecture notes and course guidance for students to read but not edit.\n\nh3 Using wikis for research groups\nA wiki allows people to work on producing a document together, such as to draft research proposals as a team, or to keep an up-to-date list of project contacts.\n\nh3 How do we get started?\nThis is the home page for your wiki. To add text to it:\n* Click the 'edit' button in the actions bar above.\n* You will see the text on this page appear in an editable text box.\n* Delete this "starter" text and type in the text that you want to appear instead. To format the text, use the button icons, which will insert the appropriate wiki formatting codes.\n* Click the 'save' button.\n
