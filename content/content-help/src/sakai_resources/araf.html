<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can follow the instructions below to set up
WebDAV from within your operating system, or you can use a third-party
client such as Cyberduck or AnyClient.  For the latter, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=azda">Uploading files to Resources or Drop Box using WebDAV with AnyClient</a>.  Some users have reported better
performance with one method than with another; if you have difficulties,
try a different client.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p>WebDAV (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning)
allows you to upload and download large files, multiple files, or folders of
files to your site more easily.</p>





 

<p>Before you set up WebDAV, at least one object (i.e., file
or folder) must be in the destination Resources or Drop Box tool. For
help, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arfs">Resources</a> or <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcg">Adding, editing, or deleting an item in Drop Box</a>.</p>

<p>Saving files directly to WebDAV (i.e., from within an application,
such as Word, Excel, or Internet Explorer) does not work
reliably. For best results, save the file to your computer first, and
then upload it to your site.</p>


<p><strong>Note:</strong> Filenames that include certain characters
cannot be accepted. For a list of unsupported characters, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=auze">Unsupported characters</a>.</p>
 

  
<p> To check your site quota and usage (if applicable), in the
Resources tool, click <strong><code>Check Quota</code></strong>.</p>

<h3>Windows 7</h3>


<p>To connect to WebDAV in Windows 7, first turn on the WebClient
service, and then create the WebDAV connection.</p>

<h4>Enabling the WebClient service</h4>

<ol><li>From the <strong><code>Start</code></strong> menu, choose <strong><code>Control Panel</code></strong>, then 
<strong><code>System and Security</code></strong>, then <strong><code>Administrative Tools</code></strong>, and 
then <strong><code>Services</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Scroll down to <strong><code>WebClient</code></strong>, set the service to <strong><code>Automatic</code></strong>,
and then click <strong><code>Apply</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>If the service is not already running, click <strong><code>Start</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Click <strong><code>OK</code></strong> to close the Control Panel.
</li></ol>

<h4>Creating a WebDAV connection</h4>

<ol><li>From the <strong><code>Start</code></strong> menu, right-click <strong><code>Computer</code></strong>, and select
<strong><code>Map network drive... </code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Enter a URL that points to the destination Resources or Drop Box tool.

<p>Contact your site administrator for the URL's format.  It will likely
include the siteID for your site. Alternatively, you may be able to
find the URL by going to the site and tool you want to connect to and
clicking <strong><code>Upload-Download Multiple Resources</code></strong>; you will
generally find instructions that include the URL.</p>





<p><strong>Note:</strong> For instructions on finding your siteID, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=atla">Determining your site's siteID</a>.</p>
</li><li>A new network location will appear.  Double-click the item to open it.

<br /><br />
</li><li>When prompted, enter your usual login  credentials.
</li></ol>

<p>You should now be able to drag and drop files and folders between your 
computer and the site to which you just connected.  To delete an item, 
right-click it and select <strong><code>Delete</code></strong>.</p>

<p>If you have difficulty dragging and dropping, right-click the file or
folder you want to copy, and choose <strong><code>Copy</code></strong>.  Then right-click
the directory you want to put it in, and choose <strong><code>Paste</code></strong>.</p>

<p>You may need to refresh your browser for the file to appear
in your directory in Resources or Drop Box.  </p>

<h3>Windows Vista</h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Connecting to your site using WebDAV on a
computer running Windows Vista does not work reliably.
However, Microsoft has a software update available that may help
correct connection problems for some users. For information about the
update and how to download it, see Microsoft Help and Support article 907306.</p>

<p> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx" target="new">Search
Microsoft Support</a>.</p>
 

<p>You can also use AnyClient as an alternative to the instructions below;
see <a href="content.hlp?docId=azda">Uploading files to Resources or Drop Box using WebDAV with AnyClient</a>.</p>

<p>To add a shortcut to your Windows Vista computer that allows you to
upload and access files using WebDAV:</p>

<ol><li>From the <strong><code>Start</code></strong> menu, right-click <strong><code>Computer</code></strong> and
select <strong><code>Map Network Drive... </code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the <code>Map Network Drive</code> window, click <strong><code>Connect to
a Web site that you can use to store your documents and pictures</code></strong>,
and then click <strong><code>Next</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Choose a custom network location</code></strong>, and then click
<strong><code>Next</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Internet or network address" field, enter a URL that
points to the destination Resources or Drop Box tool, and then click
<strong><code>Next</code></strong>.

<p>Contact your site administrator for the URL's format. It will likely
include the siteID for your site.  Alternatively, you may be able to
find the URL by going to the site and tool you want to connect to and
clicking <strong><code>Upload-Download Multiple Resources</code></strong>; you will
generally find instructions that include the URL.</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> For instructions on finding your siteID, see
<a href="content.hlp?docId=atla">Determining your site's siteID</a>.</p>
</li><li>When prompted, enter your usual login
credentials.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Give the folder a name that you will remember later, such as the name
of the associated site.</li></ol>

<p>You should now be able to drag and drop files and folders between your
computer and the sites to which you just connected.  To open a folder,
right-click it and choose <strong><code>Explore</code></strong> or <strong><code>Open</code></strong>.  To
delete an item, right-click it and select <strong><code>Delete</code></strong>.</p>

<p>If you have difficulty dragging and dropping, right-click the file or
folder you want to copy, and choose <strong><code>Copy</code></strong>.  Then right-click
the directory you want to put it in, and choose <strong><code>Paste</code></strong>.</p>

<p>You may need to refresh your browser for the file to appear
in your directory in Resources or Drop Box.  </p>

<h3>Windows XP</h3>


<p>To use the <code>Add Network Place</code> Wizard to add a shortcut to
your computer that allows you to upload and access files in Resources
or Drop Box using WebDAV:</p>

<ol><li>On the desktop, double-click <strong><code>My Network Places</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Network Tasks" pane, click <strong><code>Add a network
place</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>On the welcome screen, click <strong><code>Next</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Select <strong><code>Choose another network location</code></strong>, and then click
<strong><code>Next</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Internet or network address:" field, enter a URL that
points to the destination Resources or Drop Box tool.

<p>Contact your site administrator for
the URL's format. It will likely include the siteID for your site.
Alternatively, you may be able to find the URL by going to the site
and tool you want to connect to and clicking <strong><code>Upload-Download
Multiple Resources</code></strong>; you will generally find instructions that
include the URL.</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> For instructions on finding your siteID, see
<a href="content.hlp?docId=atla">Determining your site's siteID</a>.</p>
</li><li>When prompted, enter your usual login
credentials.

<br /><br />

</li><li>Give the folder a name you will
remember, such as the name of the associated site.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Finish</code></strong>.
</li></ol>

<p>You may now drag and drop files and folders between your computer and the
sites to which you just connected. However, you cannot delete items
from a site by dragging them to the Recycle Bin on your desktop. To
delete an item, right-click it and select <strong><code>Delete</code></strong>.</p>
