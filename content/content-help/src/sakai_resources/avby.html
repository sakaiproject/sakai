<h4>Uploading new files</h4>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The following instructions are for uploading
new files to the Resources tool. To replace an existing file with a
new version, see <a href="#update">Updating a file's contents</a>
below.</p>

<p>To upload files using Resources, in your site's <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>, click
<strong><code>Resources</code></strong>, and then follow these steps:</p>

<ol><li>Next to the folder to which you want to add a file, mouse over
<strong><code>Add</code></strong>, and click <strong><code>Upload Files</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Browse</code></strong> to find the appropriate file on your
computer or network, and then click <strong><code>Open</code></strong>.


<p><strong>Note:</strong> Filenames that include certain characters
cannot be accepted. For a list of unsupported characters, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=auze">Unsupported characters</a>.</p>

</li><li>Next to "Display Name", type the name you want displayed in
Resources. If you don't add a display name, the filename will be used.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When you use WebDAV to access your item,
you'll see only the filename, not the display name.</p>
</li><li>To add a description or any other details, such as who can access
the file or when it should be visible, click <strong><code>Add details for this
item</code></strong>, and then select from the following options:<br /><br />


<ul><li>Choose your file's copyright status, add copyright information,
and display a copyright alert:<br /><br />

<ul><li>If you select <strong><code>Use copyright below</code></strong>, a text box will appear
in which you can add information about the copyright.
</li><li>For information about copyright and fair use, click <strong><code>more
info</code></strong>.
</li><li>If you would like to display the terms to users when they access
your file, select <strong><code>Display copyright alert and require
acknowledgment when accessed by others</code></strong>. This option will require
users to agree to the copyright terms to view the resource. To see the
alert, click <strong><code>what's this?</code></strong>. You cannot edit this alert.
</li></ul><br />
</li><li>Under "Availability and Access", control who can access the file
and when its available, as follows:<br /><br />

<ul><li>To display the file to site members only, select <strong><code>Only members
of this site can see this folder and its contents.</code></strong>
</li><li>To share the file with another site to which you belong (e.g., as
an attachment to a syllabus item for another course or project you're
leading), select <strong><code>This folder and its contents are publicly
viewable.</code></strong> (This option is not available if the folder to which
you're adding the file is publicly viewable.)
</li><li>To display the file only to selected groups, select <strong><code>Display
this folder and its contents to selected groups only.</code></strong>, and then
select the group(s) that should have access to the file. For more
information on groups, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=atcs">Managing groups</a>.
</li><li>To show or hide your file, or set a beginning and/or ending date
for the file's visibility, click the appropriate selections. (This
option does not appear when you're adding an item to Resources in <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My
Workspace</a>.) Site administrators will always be able to see hidden
items, even when they are hidden from other users.
</li></ul></li></ul><br />
</li><li>To upload more than one file, click <strong><code>Add Another File</code></strong>.

<p>You can add any number of files at once, as long as the total file
size does not exceed the limit set by your system administrators. This
limit will vary depending on your institution's policies, and is
displayed at the bottom of the file upload screen.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To remove a file from the list of files to
add, click the red <strong><code>X</code></strong> next to it.</p>
</li><li>Next to "Email Notification", specify whether or not you want to
have members of the site notified automatically via email when the
resource is posted. (This option does not appear when you're adding an
item to Resources in My Workspace.)

<br /><br />
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Upload Files Now</code></strong> to finish.
</li></ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can also use WebDAV to drag and drop
files from your computer to your Resources area. For instructions, see
<a href="content.hlp?docId=araf">Uploading files to Resources using WebDAV with Windows XP or Vista</a> or <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqyi">Uploading files to Resources using WebDAV with Mac OS X</a>.</p>

<h4>Editing a file's details</h4>

<p>To edit the name, description, or availability and access settings
for a file, mouse over <strong><code>Actions</code></strong>, and then click <strong><code>Revise
Details</code></strong>. Make your changes, and then click <strong><code>Update</code></strong> to
save them.</p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="update"> </a>

<h4>Updating a file's contents</h4>

<p>Whenever you open a file from Resources, such as a Word
document, your computer creates a temporary copy and displays it,
while the original file stays on the server. If you make any changes
to the temporary copy, they are not saved automatically to the
original. If you want to change the contents of the original, you will
need to open it, make and save your changes, and then replace the
original version with your updated version.</p>

<p>To replace a Resources file with an updated version from your
computer, mouse over <strong><code>Actions</code></strong>, and then click <strong><code>Upload New
Version</code></strong>. Click <strong><code>Browse</code></strong> to select the updated file from
your computer, and then click <strong><code>Upload New Version Now</code></strong>.</p>
