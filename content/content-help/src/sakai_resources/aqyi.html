<a name="about"> </a><h3>About WebDAV</h3>


<p>WebDAV (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning)
allows you to upload and download large files, multiple files, or folders of
files to your site more easily.</p>



<p>You can use WebDAV to upload and access files in your site's
Resources or Drop Box, if you have the required permissions.</p>



 

<p>Consider the following:</p>

<ul><li>Before you set up WebDAV, at least one object (i.e., file or
folder) must be in the destination Resources or Drop Box tool. For
help, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arfs">Resources</a> or <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcg">Adding, editing, or deleting an item in Drop Box</a>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Set up WebDAV separately for each site.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Saving files to your site directly from within an application
(e.g., Word or Excel) does not work reliably. For best results, save
the file to your computer first, and then upload it to your site.
</li></ul>


<p><strong>Note:</strong> Filenames that include certain characters
cannot be accepted. For a list of unsupported characters, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=auze">Unsupported characters</a>.</p>
 

  
<p> To check your site quota and usage (if applicable), in the
Resources tool, click <strong><code>Check Quota</code></strong>.</p>

<a name="tiger"> </a><h3>Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) and later</h3>



<p>You can set up WebDAV to upload and access files either with the
third-party Cyberduck client, or natively from within Mac OS X.  If
you don't have success with one method, you may want to try the other.</p>


<a name="duck"> </a><h4>Using Cyberduck</h4>

<ol><li>Download the <a href="http://cyberduck.ch" target="new">Cyberduck WebDAV client</a>.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure to download the version that is compatible
with your version of Mac OS X.</p>
</li><li>Double-click the downloaded file to decompress it, and then drag
the Cyberduck application to your <code>Applications</code> folder.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Open Cyberduck, and in the "Quick
Connect" text box, enter a URL that points to the destination tool.

<p>Contact your site administrator for
the URL's format; it will likely include the siteID for your site. For
instructions on finding your siteID, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=atla">Determining your site's siteID</a>.</p>
</li><li>If prompted, choose <strong><code>WebDAV (HTTPS)</code></strong>
as the protocol to use.

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the resulting dialog box, fill in the fields next to
"Username:" and "Password:" with your Network ID credentials.  Click
<strong><code>Login</code></strong>.
</li></ol>

<p>You may now drag and drop folders between your computer and the
sites to which you just connected.</p>

<p>To bookmark this URL for future use, from the <strong><code>Bookmark</code></strong> menu
(Cyberduck 3.3b1 or later) or <strong><code>Action</code></strong> menu (Cyberduck 3.2.1 or
earlier), select <strong><code>New Bookmark</code></strong>.</p>

<p>When you log in, you can choose to have the passphrase
remembered in your Keychain. If you do this, you will not
be prompted for a passphrase when you log into your personal Resources
or Drop Box or the Resources for any site to which you have access. Do
not do this unless your computer is secured from use by others.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When you use WebDAV to access resources using
this method, you may notice that <code>.DS_store</code> files are
being created. Apple's knowledge base provides <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1629" target="new">instructions for eliminating this 
behavior</a>.</p>


<a name="native"> </a><h4>Using the native OS X method</h4>
<ol><li>In the Finder, press
<code>Command-k </code>. (Alternatively, from the <strong><code>Go</code></strong>
menu, choose <strong><code>Connect to Server</code></strong>.)

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Server Address:" field, enter a URL that points to
the destination tool.

<p>Contact your site administrator for the URL's format; it will
likely include the siteID for your site. For instructions on finding
your siteID, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=atla">Determining your site's siteID</a>.</p>
</li><li>Enter your username and password if prompted.
</li></ol>

<p>You may now drag and drop folders between your computer and the
sites to which you just connected.</p>

<p>Optionally, you may click the <strong><code>+</code></strong> (plus sign) to the right
of the server address after you enter it, and the server will be added
to your list of favorite servers.</p>


<p>When you log in, you can choose to have the passphrase
remembered in your Keychain. If you do this, you will not
be prompted for a passphrase when you log into your personal Resources
or Drop Box or the Resources for any site to which you have access. Do
not do this unless your computer is secured from use by others.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When you use WebDAV to access resources using
this method, you may notice that <code>.DS_store</code> files are
being created. Apple's knowledge base provides <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1629" target="new">instructions for eliminating this 
behavior</a>.</p>
