<h2>Uploading files to Resources using WebDAV
with Mac OS X</h2>

<p>WebDAV stands for "Web-based Distributed Authoring and
Versioning". It is a set of extensions to the HTTP protocol that lets
users collaboratively edit and manage files on a remote web server.</p>

<p>You can use WebDAV to upload and access files in your site's
Resources, if you have the required permissions.</p>

<p>Also, consider the following:</p>

<ul><li>Before you set up WebDAV, at least one object (i.e., file or
folder) must be in the destination Resources tool. For instructions on
adding files without using WebDAV, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=avby">Working with files in Resources</a>.
</li><li>Saving files to your site directly from within an application
(e.g., Word or Excel) does not work reliably. For best results, save
the file to your computer first, and then upload it to your site.
</li></ul>


<p><strong>Note:</strong> Filenames that include certain characters
cannot be accepted. For a list of unsupported characters, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=auze">Unsupported characters</a>.</p>






<h3>Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger)</h3>

<p>To use WebDAV to upload and access files in Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger),
follow these steps:</p>

<ol><li>In the Finder, press
<code>Cmd-k </code>. (Alternatively, from the <strong><code>Go</code></strong> menu,
choose <strong><code>Connect to Server</code></strong>.)

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Server Address:" field, you'll enter a URL that points to
the destination Resources tool.

<p>Contact your site administrator for
the URL's format; it will likely include the siteID for your site.</p>


</li></ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For instructions on finding your siteID, see
<a href="content.hlp?docId=atla">Determining your site's siteID</a>.</p>

<p>You may now drag and drop folders between your computer and the
sites to which you just connected.

</p><p>Optionally, you may click the <strong><code>+</code></strong> (plus sign) to the right
of the server address after you enter it, and the server will be added
to your list of favorite servers.</p>

<p>When you log in, you can choose to have the passphrase remembered
in your Keychain. If you do this, you will not be prompted for a
passphrase when you log into your personal Resources or the Resources
for any site to which you have access. Do not do this unless your
computer is secured from use by others.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When you use WebDAV to access resources using
this method, you may notice that <code>.DS_store</code> files are
being created. Apple's knowledge base provides instructions for
eliminating this behavior:</p>

<span class="example">  <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=301711" target="new">http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=301711</a></span>

<h3>Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) and earlier</h3>

<p>Using WebDAV to upload and access files in Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) and
earlier requires a third-party client called Goliath.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Goliath has some known performance issues, and
may not work 100% of the time. Because of this, only limited support
is available if you experience problems. </p>

<p>You can download a free copy of Goliath from:</p>

<span class="example">  <a href="http://www.webdav.org/goliath/installs/Goliath1_0_1.dmg.gz" target="new">http://www.webdav.org/goliath/installs/Goliath1_0_1.dmg.gz</a></span>

<p>Once you have downloaded the file, double-click it to decompress
it. Then double-click the resulting <code>.dmg</code> file. A disk
image named <code>Goliath 1.0.1</code> should now be available.
Follow these steps:</p>

<ol><li>Drag and drop the Goliath folder contained within the disk image
to your hard disk.

<br /><br /> 
</li><li>Open the Goliath application.

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Server Address:" field, enter a URL that points to the
destination Resources tool.

<p>Contact your site administrator for
the URL's format; it will likely include the siteID for your site.</p>


</li></ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For instructions on finding your siteID, see
<a href="content.hlp?docId=atla">Determining your site's siteID</a>.</p>


<p>The first time you attempt to connect, you may be prompted to
accept a certificate for the site. Click <strong><code>OK</code></strong> if prompted.</p>

<p>You may now drag and drop folders between your computer and the
sites to which you just connected.</p>
