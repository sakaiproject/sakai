<h3>Editing a resource item</h3>

<p>The edit option allows you to edit a resource from within the
Resources tool. If you want to edit an existing resource, you can
either revise it or replace it, depending on the type of resource. You
can revise plain text and HTML documents; for other document types,
the edit option only allows you to revise the information about the
resource (e.g., the description), or replace the document's contents
(e.g., replace a picture or URL). You can only replace document
content with documents you upload from your own computer, one at a
time.</p>

<p>To edit a resource:</p>

<ol><li>If it is a document type for which you can revise the content, you
will see a drop-down list labeled "Content:" from which you should
choose either <strong><code>Revise document contents below</code></strong> or <strong><code>Replace
with content from my computer</code></strong>. If it's a document type for which
you can only replace content, click the <strong><code>Browse...</code></strong> button
beside "Replace with this file:".<br /><br />
</li><li>For either option, alter any information about the resource you'd
like to change as well, including the optional properties. (To view
the optional properties, click the arrow beside "Optional
properties".)
</li></ol>

you want to delete, click <strong><code>Delete</code></strong>. A confirmation screen will appear asking if
you are sure you want to delete the item. Click <strong><code>Delete</code></strong> to
confirm, or click <strong><code>Cancel</code></strong>.</p>
