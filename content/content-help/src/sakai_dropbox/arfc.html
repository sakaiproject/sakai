<h2>Drop Box: Overview</h2>
<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>The Drop Box feature allows instructors and students to share
documents within a private folder for each student. The Drop Box works
like Resources to allow you to upload many types of files and multiple
files at a time. The Drop Box also allows nested folders (folders
within folders).</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Progress reports:</strong> Instructors can use the Drop Box
tool to provide private progress reports to each student in the class.</p>

<p><strong>Adding participants:</strong> When you add participants or
students to a site, either automatically or manually, they will
have Drop Box folders by default (if the Drop Box is currently enabled).</p>


<h3>Things to consider</h3>
<ul><li>A new Drop Box item will automatically go into the folder that you
have open when you create the item.  <br /><br /> 
</li><li>For plain text documents, HTML pages, and web links that you
create in the Drop Box interface, you can edit the content, as well as
information about the item, such as its name or description.  For
uploaded files, you can edit only the information about the item, not
the content; to change the content, you must upload a new version of
the file.<br /><br />

</li><li>Whenever you add an item to the Drop Box, you have the option of
sending an automatic email notification.  <br /><br />
</li><li>Make sure you know the laws and policies regarding the use of
copyrighted material. 
</li></ul>
