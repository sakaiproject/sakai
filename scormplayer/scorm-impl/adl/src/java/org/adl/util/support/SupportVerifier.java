 *
 * <strong>Description:</strong><br>
 * A <code>SupportVerifier</code> provides the ability to display support 
 * errors.  If the software was not tested for support, messages will be 
 * displayed in the following manner:
 * <ul>
 *    <li><strong>Operating System</strong> - If the user is running the software
 *     on an unsupported or untested Operating System, a warning is displayed 
 *     and the user is allowed to continue.</li>
 *    <li><strong>Java Version</strong> - If the user is running the software 
 *    with an unsupported or untested Java Version, an error is displayed and 
 *    the program is terminated.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <strong>Design Issues:</strong><br><br>
 *
 * <strong>Implementation Issues:</strong><br><br>
 *
 * <strong>Known Problems:</strong><br><br>
 *
 * <strong>Side Effects:</strong><br>
 * If an unsupported Java version is detected, the program will terminate.
 * <br><br>
