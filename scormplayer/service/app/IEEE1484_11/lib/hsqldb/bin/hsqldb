### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:          HSQLDB-Server
# Required-Start:    $syslog $remote_fs $network $named
# Required-Stop:
# Default-Start:     3 5
# Default-Stop:      0 1 2 6
# Short-Description: HSQLDB-Server
# Description:       Hsqldb, A High Performance Java Database Server
### END INIT INFO

# N.b.  Being a system script, this script does not use inherited variables.
# If you want to adjust a setting, edit the config file.

# Strategy of this init script is to avoid shell-specific functionality,
# and use only lowest-common-denominator Bourne capabilities.
# We don't include OS-specific functions, and we don't use shell-
# implementation-specific functionality like "echo ...\c" or "echo -n...".
# Since some Bourne shells don't support shell functions at all, we don't
# even define any local functions.

# This script has been generalized to the point that it can now "start"
# any combination of classes with the normal static main methods.
# However, you must still have a TARGET_CLASS which is a HSQLDB Server or
# WebServer  We connect to this server to check for status and to shut down.
# This is the one class which must use the default server property file 
# name, either "server.properties" or "webserver.properties" (because
# we get the list of urlids to check from this file).
# Other than these constraints, you can supply invocation arguments to the
# Server/WebServer invocation, and can start as many other classes as you
# wish by using the INVOC_ADDL_ARGS setting (this includes running
# multiple HSQLDB Servers of various types).

# Recommended locations for configuration file:
#   Darwin, SunOS, Solaris:  /etc/hsqldb.conf
#              (However, Sunfreeware.com builds use /usr/local/etc).
#   Linux:  /etc/sysconfig
#   FreeBSD:  /usr/local/etc/hsqldb.cfg
# You can put it at any of these locations and it will be used.  For
# your sanity, only put a file at one of these locations.

#  -- blaine.simpson@admc.com

set +u

# This is only used for recursive invocations.
