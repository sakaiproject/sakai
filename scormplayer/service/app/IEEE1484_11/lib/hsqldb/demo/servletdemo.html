<h2>HSQL Database Engine Servlet Demo</h2>
<applet code="org.hsqldb.util.QueryTool" archive="hsqldb.jar" width="460" height="400" codebase="../lib/">
<param name="database" value="http://localhost:8080/examples/servlet/hsqlServlet">
</applet>
<p>
In this demo, the DatabaseManager uses the Servlet to access the database. The QueryTool is running inside
the internet browser as an Applet.
<p>
<h2>If it does not work</h2>
<p>This demo requires a servlet engine to be running and listening to port 8080. The hsqlServlet.java servlet should be installed on the servlet engine in the /examples/servlet/ directory.</p>
<p>On some browsers (Netscape 4.6?), the version compiled for
JDK 1.2 does not work. In the Java Console (Communicator
/ Extras / Java Console) you will get something like:
</p>
<p>
# Verifier error org/hsqldb/jdbcConnection.getTypeMap()Ljava/util/Map
<p>
This means the class java.util.Map was not found. In JDK 1.1,
this class does not exist. When compiled for 1.2, there is
a reference this class required to conform the JDBC 2.0 interface.
This class itself is never used, but the reference is required anyway.
It looks like most verifiers have no problem with this, but some
have.
<p>
The (only) solution for this problem is to recompile (at least the
client part) for JDK 1.1. You will need to install JDK 1.1 before
you can do this, then see:
