 * 
 * <strong>Filename:</strong> SCORM12APIInterface.java<br><br>
 * 
 * <strong>Description:</strong><br>
 * This interface represents the API Interface for SCO to LMS communication as
 * defined in the SCORM Version 1.2.  This class contains all method signatures
 * that are available for SCORM Version 1.2 Conformant SCOs.<br><br>
 * 
 * <strong>Design Issues:</strong><br>
 * <br>
 * 
 * <strong>Implementation Issues:</strong><br>
 * It is the responsibility of the implementation of this interface to
 * perform any and all LMS behaviors including but not limited to error code 
 * management as defined in the SCORM Version 1.2.<br><br>
 * <b>Note: </b>Due to the nature and syntax of the SCORM API, this file does 
 * not follow the ADL Java Coding Standard for method names.<br><br>
 * 
 * <strong>Known Problems:</strong><br><br>

	 * them on the client.  In such implementations, this API call is redundant 
	 * and would result in no additional action from the API Adapter.  This call
