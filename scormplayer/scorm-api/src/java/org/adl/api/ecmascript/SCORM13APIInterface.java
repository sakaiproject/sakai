 * <strong>Filename:</strong> SCORM13APIInterface.java<br><br>
 *
 * <strong>Description:</strong><br>
 * This interface represents the API Interface for SCO to LMS communication as
 * defined in the SCORM 2004.  This class contains all method signatures
 * that are available for SCORM 2004 Conformant SCOs.<br><br>
 *
 * <strong>Design Issues:</strong><br>
 * <br>
 *
 * <strong>Implementation Issues:</strong><br>
 * It is the responsibility of the implementation of this interface to
 * perform any and all LMS behaviors including but not limited to error code
 * management as defined in the SCORM 2004.<br><br>
 * <b>Note: </b>Due to the nature and syntax of the SCORM API, this file does 
 * not follow the ADL Java Coding Standard for method names.<br><br>
