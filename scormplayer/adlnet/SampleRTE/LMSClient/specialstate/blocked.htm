   NOTES:<br />
   The <i>[BLOCKED]</i> page indicates that the ADL Sequencer hit a point in the 
   conceptual activity tree that it could no longer traverse and the candidate activity 
   was not deliverable.
   <br /><br />
   Typical reasons this page is being encountered include:
   <ul>
      <li>A Start Navigation Request has failed to identify an available leaf activity.</li>
      <li>A Continue or Previous Navigation Request has encountered a disabled activity.  
         Activities can become ‘disabled’ from any of the following reasons:
         <ul>
            <li>Limit Condition violation</li>
            <li>Disabled Precondition Sequencing Rule</li>
         </ul> 
      </li>
      <li>A Choice Navigation Request has targeted a cluster that does not 
         have an available descendent leaf activity.</li>
      <li>A Choice Navigation Request has targeted an activity that 
         “constrained” relative to the Current Activity.</li>
   </ul>
