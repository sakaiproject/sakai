# Code of Conduct

What you should know about us is this our common understanding off the collaborative, shared environment and goals we have for ourselves. This code is far from exhaustive or complete but we trust it communicates what we expect of each other and follow as much in spirit as in the letter, so that it enriches us and the technical communities in which we participate.

We welcome and encourage participation by everyone. We're committed to being a community that everyone feels good about joining. We work to treat everyone well. We honor diversity in age, culture, ethnicity, genotype, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, political beliefs, race, religion, socioeconomic status, subculture and technical ability.

Specifically, we strive to:
1. Be open.
2. Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly and patient.
3. Be collaborative.
4. Be inquisitive.
5. Be careful in the words we choose. (We value professionalism in all interactions and take responsibility for our own speech).
6. Be concise. We recognize each others time and endeavor to stay on topic, and to keep our emails on point as well as friendly.
7. Step down considerately. Given that members of every project come and go, we take steps to tell people if we are disengaging or leaving, and to help others pick up where one of us left off.
