# Code of Conduct

As an Apereo Foundation sponsored project, Sakai's code of conduct expands upon the Apereo Foundation welcoming policy which can be read in its entirety here [Apereo Foundation Welcoming Policy].

The Sakai code of conduct seeks not to be exhaustive or complete but to function as our joint interpretation of the Apereo welcoming policy. It serves to distill our common understanding of our shared collaborative environment and goals.

# Specifically
We strive to:
1. Be open, invite all to participate in our community. We prefer public methods of communication unless discussing something sensitive.
2. Be friendly, patient and empathetic. We assume good intentions and do our best to act in an empathetic fashion.
3. Be collaborative. We build upon the work of others and in turn our work will be used by others.
4. Be inquisitive. Nobody knows everything. We seek to ask plenty of questions, the earlier the better.
5. Be careful in the words and actions we choose. We take responsibility for same- we do not put down or insult other participants. Harrassment and other exclusionary behaviors are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
    Violent threats or language against another person
    Sexist, racist or otherwise discriminary jokes or language
    Posting sexually or violently explicit material
    Sharing private content
    Excessive or unnecessary profanity
    Repeated harassment of others. If someone asks you to stop, then stop.
    Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
