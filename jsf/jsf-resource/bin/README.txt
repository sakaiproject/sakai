This is the Maven project for the web resources used by the custom JSF widgets.  
These resources will be deployed as a war file.  
This includes things like external JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc.
The widgets and the resource projects are closely tied together.
Web applications that use the Sakai JSF components will also need this webapp deployed.
