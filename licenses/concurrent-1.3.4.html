<H1>Overview of package util.concurrent Release 1.3.4.</H1>

  by <A href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl">Doug Lea</A>
  <P>
Note: Upon release of J2SE 5.0, this package enters maintenance mode:
Only essential corrections will be released. J2SE5 package <A href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/concurrency-interest/index.html">java.util.concurrent </A> includes improved, more efficient,
standardized versions of the main components in this package. Please
plan to convert your applications to use them. (A few niche classes
here have no equivalents in java.util.concurrent. They will become
part of a follow-up add-on package that will also include other
unstandardized classes.) If you cannot convert to J2SE5 immediately,
consider using a backport of the main java.util.concurrent classes by
<A href="http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/dcl/util/backport-util-concurrent/"> Dawid Kurzyniec </A>.


</P><P>   This package provides standardized, efficient versions of utility
   classes commonly encountered in concurrent Java programming.  This
   code consists of implementations of ideas that have been around for
   ages, and is merely intended to save you the trouble of coding them.
   Discussions of the rationale and applications of several of these
   classes can be found in the second edition of <A href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/cpj">Concurrent Programming in
   Java</A>.  There are also <A href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/cpjslides/util.pdf">pdf
   slides</A> providing an overview of the package.
    

  </P><P>
   The package mainly consists of implementations of a few interfaces:
   <BR>
  </P><UL>
   <LI><CODE>Sync</CODE> -- locks, conditions <BR>
   </LI><LI><CODE>Channel</CODE> -- queues, buffers <BR>
   </LI><LI><CODE>Barrier</CODE> -- multi-party synchronization <BR>

   </LI><LI><CODE>SynchronizedVariable</CODE> -- atomic ints, refs etc <BR>

   </LI><LI><CODE>java.util.Collection</CODE> -- collections <BR>

   </LI><LI><CODE>Executor</CODE> -- replacements for direct use of Thread <BR>
  </LI></UL>
   
   Plus some utilities and frameworks that build upon these.
  <P>   If you arrived at page<BR>

  This package, currently declared as
  <BLOCKQUOTE>   <CODE>EDU.oswego.cs.dl.util.concurrent</CODE> 
  </BLOCKQUOTE>

  is available in (<A href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/classes/EDU/oswego/cs/dl/current/concurrent.tar.gz">tar.gz
format</A>) or (<A href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/classes/EDU/oswego/cs/dl/current/concurrent.zip">zip
format</A>).

  <P>
  It is currently distributed in source form only. To build it, use a
   Java 1.2+ compiler to:
</P><PRE>  javac -d <EM>[SOMEWHERE IN YOUR CLASSPATH]</EM> *.java
</PRE>
  Or use this <A href="build.xml">ant build file</A> donated by
  Travell Perkins.
  <P>   The classes in the <CODE>misc</CODE> directory can be built the
   same way.
  </P><P>
   To use it, add to java files:
</P><PRE>  import EDU.oswego.cs.dl.util.concurrent.*
</PRE>
  <P> You can also create a jar or zip file of the compiled classes
   and add them to your classpath.
  </P><P>
   All <A href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/classes/index.html"> documentation</A>
    except for this file was produced by javadoc, which
    places some index and summary files outside the current
    directory. This can cause some broken links on unpacked versions.
    You can avoid this, and integrate with your local javadoc-produced
    documentation by running:
</P><PRE>  javadoc -public -d <EM>[BASE OF SOME JAVADOC PATH]</EM> *.java

<H2>Some Questions and Answers about Design and Implementation</H2>

  <DL><DT>Isn't it annoying that so many methods throw InterruptedException?

   </DT><DD> Maybe, but synchronization points are among the best points to
   detect interruption. Since this a package of synchronization aids,
   most methods detect interruption as early and often as reasonable
   to help avoid becoming stuck when the thread should be stopping
   anyway. In particular, interruption is normally checked before
   trying to obtain locks used in Syncs, which minimizes the
   vulnerability window for getting stuck when an activity is
   cancelled.  (Between this and the finite durations that internal
   java synchronization locks are held in Sync classes, it is normally
   impossible for threads to become stuck waiting on internal locks
   when they have been interrupted.)  These classes fail cleanly upon
   interruption. Normally, all you need to do upon catching an
   InterruptedException is either rethrow it, or clean up and then set
    <CODE>Thread.currentThread().interrupt()</CODE> to propagate
    status.
    <P>
  If you need to invoke such methods even when the thread is in an
  interrupted state (for example, during recovery actions) you can do:
</P><PRE>  void quietlyAcquire(Sync sync) {
    boolean wasInterrupted = Thread.interrupted(); // record and clear
    for (;;) {
      try {
        sync.acquire();   // or any other method throwing InterruptedException
        break;
      }
      catch (InterruptedException ex) { // re-interrupted; try again
        wasInterrupted = true;
      }
    }
    if (wasInterrupted) {              // re-establish interrupted state
      Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
    }
 }
</PRE>
    <P>     The heavy use of InterruptedException makes it possible to write
     very responsive and robust code, at the expense of forcing class
     and method authors to contemplate possible exception handling
     actions at each interruption (and time-out) point. See the <A href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/cpj/cancel.html">CPJ supplement
     page on cancellation</A> for more discussion of some associated
     design issues.

    </P><P>

   </P></DD><DT>Why is there so much near-duplication of code?

   </DT><DD> You'd think there would be some nice way to unify more classes
   to share significant aspects of synchronization mechanics.  But
   standard lines of attack for doing this turn out unsatisfying at
   best.  The main reason for creating this package is that even
   simple classes involving concurrency control mechanics are
   sometimes tedious, repetitive, tricky, and/or error-prone to write,
   so it is nice to have them written already.
    <P>
   </P></DD><DT>Why do most methods return false/null after timeouts rather
   than throwing TimeoutException?

   </DT><DD> Because I think it would normally be misleading to throw
   exceptions. In Java, timeout arguments merely provide hints about
   when threads should be woken to check out the state of the world.
   Due to scheduling delays, threads need not resume immediately after
   their timeouts elapse, so real-time-based timeout exceptions would
   not be appropriate. The simplest course of action is just to report
   whether the condition the thread is waiting for does hold after
   waiting for at least this period. Returning false/null is not
   necessarily an exceptional situation.  In those classes where it is
   exceptional (in some classes layered on top of basic Syncs and
   Channels) failed timeouts are converted to TimeoutExceptions. You
   can do the same in your own code using these classes. As of version
   1.1.0, this is made simpler to carry out, since TimeoutException
   now extends InterruptedException.
    <P>
   </P></DD><DT>Why aren't there deadlock-detecting Syncs or related classes for
    detecting lockups?

   </DT><DD>Because timeouts appear to be more generally useful. In fact,
   it is hard to imagine contexts where deadlock detection is a better
   option than timeouts in Java. A timeout can serve as a heuristic
   deadlock detection device, but can also serve to detect stalled IO,
   network partitions, and related failures. Program responses to
   deadlock are hardly ever different than responses to these other
   failures. So, it is usually a good idea to use timeouts as
   general-purpose heuristic detectors for all liveness problems,
   subdividing responses to particular failures (for example, by
   subclassing TimeoutException), only when necessary. Additionally,
   there are two problems with implementing deadlock-detecting Syncs
   that make them unattractive choices: (1) They can only detect
   deadlock among uses of the particular Sync classes being used, so
   cannot deal with deadlocks involving builtin synchronization (2)
   lock cycle detection adds overhead to each lock acquire and
   release.  The main context in which deadlock detection would be
   useful is during program debugging, but here, it would be better to
   rely on specially instrumented JVMs. (Note that it is easy to
   transform code that relies on acquire to instead use timeouts via
   the TimeoutSync class. This can be a good way to make code more
   robust with respect to locking problems.)
    <P>
   </P></DD><DT> Why isn't there a distinct Lock or MutualExclusionLock interface?

   </DT><DD> Because many objects implementing the Sync interface can be
   used as locks if they are in appropriate states, but not all of
   them can always be used as such. Additionally, there are several
   senses of mutual exclusion (for example, reentrant vs
   non-reentrant, full vs read/write).  Since there is no way to say
   that a given class only sometimes conforms to the intended sense of
   a subinterface, the flexibility and simplicity of only using a
   single principle interface (Sync) for all such types outweighs the
   potential advantages of finer-grained categorizations.
    <P>
    </P></DD><DT> Why do so many methods perform notify within InterruptedException 
    catches?
    
    </DT><DD> Because when notify's and interrupt's happen at about the
    same time, JVMs are currently free to treat them independently, so
    a notified thread could return out as interrupted.  In classes
    using notify rather than notifyAll, the extra notify in the catch
    clause is a safeguard to ensure that a non-interrupted thread, if
    one exists, will be notified. See my CPJ book for more details.
    <P>
   </P></DD><DT> How efficient are these classes?

   </DT><DD> Most of these classes use the most efficient implementations I
   know of for general-purpose concurrent programming, yet also try to
   be conservative about differences across common JVMs, and to
   minimize surprising limitations and side-effects.  This is always a
   bit of a trade-off though. Some could be made more efficient at the
   cost of supporting fewer operations, relying on properties of
   particular JVMs, or having more usage constraints. Conversely some
   could support more contexts or operations, or simpler usage, at the
   cost of efficiency.

    <P>
     You will almost surely trade off some cost in efficiency for the
     flexibility of using Syncs and classes built out of them rather
     than built-in <CODE>synchronized</CODE> method/block locks. On
     some JVMs the cost is very low. (You can check approximate impact
     using <A href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/classes/EDU/oswego/cs/dl/util/concurrent/misc/SynchronizationTimer.html">SynchronizationTimer</A>.)
     But, while Java VMs are getting much faster about
     <CODE>synchronized</CODE> locks, most of the classes in this
     package rely heavily on wait/notify and interruption mechanics,
     which are not currently as heavily optimized. (Also, they seem to
     be subject to more variation in behavior than other Java
     constructs.)  Class implementations generally ignore the fact
     that the JVM overhead for these operations might be slower than
     you'd wish they were on some JVMs.

    </P><P>

   </P></DD><DT> Are there any programming errors?

   </DT><DD> I don't believe so. Please try to prove me wrong. If you are
    the first person to discover a particular coding error in a
    current release, I'll send you a free copy of my CPJ book.  Also,
    I would greatly appreciate receiving any sample applications that
    can help serve as useful tests, so as to build up a more extensive
    test suite.
    <P>
   </P></DD><DT> Should I worry about the use of <TT>volatile</TT> in these
   classes?

   </DT><DD> Many JVMs are known not to correctly implement the JLS spec
   (either the original or the upcoming revision) for volatile fields.
   However, volatiles are used in conservative ways in this package,
   that don't encounter problems at least on recent Sun and IBM JVMs.

    <P>

   </P></DD><DT> Why do classes declare practically all internal matters as
    <CODE>protected</CODE>?

   </DT><DD> While probably 99% of the uses of these classes should
   just treat them as black-box utility components, these classes are
   intended to be extensible, to allow more specialized
   synchronization control to be customized for different
   applications.  However, it takes a lot of expertise to extend or
   modify most of them via subclassing. If you do try to extend,
   consider first running javadoc on these classes with switches that
   generate documentation for non-public classes, methods, and
   fields. Also, if you encounter problems making subclasses due to
   inflexibility in base classes, I'd like to hear about it, so I can
   try to come up with a better factoring.
    <P>
    </P></DD><DT> Why aren't most classes <CODE>Serializable</CODE>?
    </DT><DD> I don't know what to about this. On one hand, it wouldn't
    make sense in a lot of contexts to serialize, say, a Semaphore. On
    the other hand, maybe it ought not be precluded.  Opinions
    welcome. One suggestion is to only declare as serializable those
    classes specifically designed to work with other persistent or
    distributed concurrency control frameworks. (No such classes
    currently exist.)
    <P>
    </P></DD><DT> Why didn't using ReadWriteLocks instead of plain
    synchronization speed up my program?
    </DT><DD> ReadWriteLocks have more overhead than do synchronized
    methods or blocks.  They pay off only when the code being
    protected by the locks is time-consuming, and when readers
    outnumber writers, so the increased concurrency outweighs the
    increased bookkeeping.  (They are also sometimes of use in
    avoiding deadlock.)  Special-purpose data structures such as the
    Concurrent hash tables in this package have far less overhead, and
    typically much better performance than placing ReadWriteLocks
    around most sequential data structures.
    <P>
   </P></DD><DT>Are instances of these classes externally lockable -- that is,
    can I control object <CODE>x</CODE> via <CODE>synchronized(x) {
    ... }</CODE> ?
   </DT><DD> Not necessarily. Some objects rely on their own
    synchronization locks, some rely on internal locks, some rely on
    other synchronization objects.  So in general, you cannot know the
    effect of <CODE>synchronized(x)</CODE> and so probably ought never
    use it.
    <P>
   </P></DD><DT> Why do I get strict alternation of producer and consumer
    threads when using buffered channels such as BoundedBuffer?

   </DT><DD> Although it depends on details of JVM scheduling policies,
   this is the most likely result when producer and consumer actions
   both take about the same amount of time to process, since both put
   and take operations signal waiting threads. The point of buffering
   is to decouple producers and consumers when one or the other is
   bursty, so temporarily gets ahead or behind its average rate. (If
   the average rates of producers and consumers are not approximately
   equal, buffering is not of much use.) While it again relies on JVM
   details, unbounded buffers (for example LinkedQueue) typically do
   not result in alternation, allowing producers to get arbitrarily
   ahead of consumers, at the expense of potential resource
   exhaustion.

    <P>
   </P></DD><DT>Why aren't there timeout methods supporting nanosecond
   arguments?
   </DT><DD> Because most JVMs only time to millisecond accuracy (at best)
    anyway.  If this changes, nanosecond versions could be added.
    <P>
   </P></DD><DT>Why is the package named <CODE>EDU</CODE>..., not <CODE>edu</CODE>?
   </DT><DD>I've been using the initially-recommended upper-case EDU prefix
    for a long time for my packages. It would take a lot of busy-work
    to convert everything to the now-recommended practice of using
    lower-case. Someday I will do this though.

    <P>

   </P></DD><DT> Why do you use those ugly underscores?!
   </DT><DD> Because otherwise I tend to make coding mistakes surrounding
   instance variables versus local variables. See my <A href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/javaCodingStd.html"> Sample
   Java Coding Standard</A>. But I think I've decided to reform :-)
   Newer classes use a more JDK-like set of conventions.
    <P>
   </P></DD><DT> Why don't you supply Ant build scripts? Or Jar files?  Or
   rearrange into separate src/doc/lib directories? Or CVS? Or ...?
   </DT><DD> There are too many different ways people would like to use
   this package for me to keep up with.  So I release it in a simple
   way that should be very easy to adapt to all sorts of different
   needs and conventions.
   <P>
   </P></DD><DT> Is this code in any way tied to Sun JDK releases?

   </DT><DD> No.  The acknowlegdment to Sun Labs in headers recognizes
   their generous donations of equipment and release time support that
   help make this work possible. But this software is not in any way
   tied to Sun. However, work is underway to create a JSR with the
   goal of including a similar package in a future JDK release.

    <P>
   </P></DD><DT>Can I use this code in commercial products?
   </DT><DD>Yes. Many people appear to do so.
    <P>
   </P></DD><DT>Do I need a license to use it? Can I get one?
   </DT><DD>No!
    <P>
   </P></DD><DT>Can I get commercial support for this package?
   </DT><DD>I don't know of any place to get it. I can't think of any
    technical reason that you'd want it.
    <P>
  </P></DD></DL>
