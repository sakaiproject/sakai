  <p>When you create a new assignment, the Open Date will default to the current day, and the Due Date and Accept Until dates will default to one week later.  Change the dates using the calendar icon to bring up the date-picker pop-up calendar.</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>Open Date</strong> for your assignment is when it becomes available for students.  </li>
<li>The <strong>Due Date</strong> is the deadline to turn in the assignment.</li>
<li>The<strong> Accept Until</strong> date allows you to accept late submissions after the due date (late student submissions marked as late). If you do not accept late submissions, you may leave the Due Date and Accept Until date the same.</li>

<p><em>Tip: Often, faculty like to set the time on the due date to 11:55 PM, as that is the latest time you can select on a given day. Selecting 12:00 AM will display the date as the next day, and this may confuse students about the actual due date if they assume they have all day to turn in their work. </em></p>

  <p>Within the points grade scale, there is also the option to<strong> Send grades to the Gradebook.</strong> Once selected, this reveals two additional options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Create new Gradebook item:</strong> This will create a new item in the gradebook with the same name as your assignment title.</li>
<li>
<strong>Associate with existing Gradebook item:</strong> This option allows you to link your assignment to an existing gradebook item. This is useful if you have already created items in your gradebook and you want to use one of them, rather than creating a new assignment.
