        <p>The settings of a test or quiz are complex, and offer many options. &nbsp;In many cases, the default values will work, but should be reviewed. &nbsp;The modification of a setting in one section will not change settings in other sections.</p>
<p>You can modify the settings, parts, and questions of any assessment listed under the <strong>Working Copies </strong>tab. When you publish an assessment, a copy is created and listed under <strong>Published Copies</strong>. For the published copy, you can make changes to all the settings except "Assessment Released To".</p>
<p><em>Note: After you've published an assessment, if you modify the unpublished version under Working Copies, you'll have to alter the assessment's name before republishing it. When you publish it, you'll be creating another publication under Published Copies, not replacing the existing published copy. Also, if you modify the settings of a test while students are taking it, the changes will not affect testing sessions in progress. Students must exit the test and re-enter it in order to have the modified settings take effect.</em></p>

<p>Feedback Delivery controls if and when students are able see their submission results. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>No Feedback</strong> (the default setting) does not display any feedback to the student.</li>
<li>
<strong>Immediate feedback</strong> is recommended for self-tests only, as it will display the answers immediately - PRIOR to the student submitting the assessment.</li>
<li>
<strong>Feedback on submission</strong> displays feedback to students as soon as they submit the assessment. (This is the most common setting.)</li>
<li>
<strong>Feedback on a specific date </strong>releases assessment feedback upon the date and time specified.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Tip: &nbsp;If you are concerned about students sharing their exam results with one another, you should choose either </em><em><strong>No Feedback </strong></em><em>or </em><em><strong>Feedback on a specific date</strong></em><em>. &nbsp;For the latter, selecting a date after the closing date for the assessment will prevent students from sharing feedback with other students who have not yet taken the test.</em></p>
