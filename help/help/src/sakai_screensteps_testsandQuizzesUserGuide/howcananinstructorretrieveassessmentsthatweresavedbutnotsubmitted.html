  <p>When a student clicks the <strong>Submit for Grading</strong> button on the last page of an assessment or the <em>Table of Contents</em>, they are taken to an <em>Assessment Submission Warning</em> screen to confirm their submission. If they do not click the final <strong>Submit for Grading</strong> button to confirm, and the assessment is NOT timed, their responses may be saved, but the assessment will remain <em>In Progress</em>.</p>
<p>Instructors do not have access to the content of<em> In Progress</em> assessments. On the <a href="content.hlp?docId=howdoiviewstatisticsaboutacompletedassessmentgototestsquizzes"><em>Total Scores</em></a> screen, students with incomplete submissions would be listed as having <em>No Submission</em> recorded.</p>
<p>However, if a student has not yet submitted a copy of an untimed assessment, an instructor can retrieve their submission using the <strong>Automatic Submission</strong> (<strong>Autosubmit</strong>) feature in <em>Tests &amp; Quizzes</em>.</p>
<p><em>Note: The autosubmit option is only available if it has been enabled on your system.</em></p>
</div>

      <div class="step screensteps-section screensteps-depth-1" id="how-does-automatic-submission-work">
    <h2 class="step-title screensteps-heading">How does automatic submission work?</h2>
      <div class="step-instructions screensteps-textblock">
  <p>The <strong>Autosubmit</strong> setting can be enabled on a per-assessment basis and is unchecked (not enabled) by default. For more information on how to enable automatic submission in an assessment's settings, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=whataretheavailabilityandsubmissionsoptionsforanassessment">Availability and Submissions options: Automatic submission</a>, or the steps below.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, there is an automated process that will check:</p>
<ol>
<li>Did the instructor select the <strong>Autosubmit</strong> setting on this assessment?</li>
<li>Did the <strong>latest acceptance date</strong> for this assessment pass yet?</li>
<li>Did this student press the <strong>Begin Assessment</strong> button, save their work, but fail to successfully submit the assessment via the <strong>Submit for Grading</strong> button on the <em>Assessment Submission Warning</em> screen?</li>
<li>Is this the student's first submission attempt?</li>
</ol>
<p>If all four conditions above are true, the system will automatically submit the student’s saved assessment. The submission data will be available to instructors on the <a href="content.hlp?docId=howdoiviewstatisticsaboutacompletedassessmentgototestsquizzes"><em>Total Scores</em></a> screen within five minutes (or however often your system is configured to run) after the <strong>latest acceptance date</strong> passes.</p>
<p>Instructors can review all student submissions normally. Any assessments that were submitted via the automatic submission feature will be flagged on the <em>Total Scores</em> screen with the text <em>AUTO-SUBMIT</em>. All answers that were saved will be included in the student's automatic submission.</p>
<p><em>Note: Timed assessments are automatically submitted when the timer expires, so you do not need to enable Autosubmit for a timed assessment.</em></p>
