  <p>Below are screen shots with examples of the email notifications you'll receive if you've selected to receive email for submissions from <em>Tests &amp; Quizzes</em>.  There are several types of notifications, corresponding to the different ways in which an assessment can be submitted:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Manual submission:</strong> A student clicks the <strong>Submit for Grading </strong>button on the <em>Assessment Submission Warning</em> screen to confirm submitting an assessment.</li>
<li>
<strong>Timer submission:</strong> The timer expires on a timed assessment and automatically submits the assessment for the student.</li>
<li>
<strong>Automatic submission:</strong> An instructor has configured an assessment to <a rel="nofollow" href="content.hlp?docId=howcananinstructorretrieveassessmentsthatweresavedbutnotsubmitted">Autosubmit saved student work after latest acceptance date, unless student has previously submitted</a>.  A student saves content in the assessment and exits it before the latest acceptance date, so the assessment remains <em>In Progress</em>.  The saved assessment is automatically submitted at the latest acceptance date provided no other attempt has been submitted.</li>
