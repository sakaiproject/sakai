        <p>By default, only you will be able to access the question pools you create, but you can share your question pools with other instructors from within the system.</p>
<p>You can only share a question pool with a user who has permission to create assessments, and you must share the question pool from a site for which both you and the user have such a role; it does not have to be the site where you created the pool.</p>
<p>Once someone shares a question pool with you, you can then access the pool from any site in which you have the ability to create assessments, unless the creator of the pool revokes access.</p>
<p>Pool owners will see the names of everyone with whom they've shared the pool on the Share Pool screen in all of their own sites. If someone with whom a pool has been shared is not a member of the site the pool owner is viewing, that person will be listed under "Site Members with Access" with the role of "anonymous_access".</p>
<p>Removing a user from a site does not remove access to any question pools you've shared with him or her.</p>
