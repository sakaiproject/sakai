<p><em>Note: If you choose the option to Allow Retake for a student, and the assessment only allows one submission, the submission you'll see will depend on the Recorded Score setting. If your assessment includes manually graded questions, and you already graded it before allowing the student to retake it, the highest score will most likely be the first submission. You might need to change an assessment setting (either the Recorded Score or number of submissions allowed) after all the students have completed the assessment to view the retake results.</em></p>
