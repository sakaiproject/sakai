  <p>Resources are available in both Home and individual course sites. The Resources tool is site-dependent; the content uploaded in the Home area is private and visible only to the user (unless the user chooses to make items public). </p>
<p>The Resources tool in Home serves as a personal file space for the user to save, store, and organize files. </p>
<p>The features and functionality of the Resources tool are the same in any site where the tool appears. Please refer to <a rel="nofollow" href="content.hlp?docId=whatistheresourcestoolcopied">What is the Resources tool?</a> for more information on how to manage files using this tool.</p>
<p><em>Note: Your institution may limit the user file storage quota and/or access to Resources in Home.</em></p>

  <p><em>Tip: Users who would like to store large files in a single location may choose to store files in Home and link to them from their other course sites, rather than uploading them to multiple locations. Be sure to mark your files as Public if you plan to link to them from other sites.</em></p>
