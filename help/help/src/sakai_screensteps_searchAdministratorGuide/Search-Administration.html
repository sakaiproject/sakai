It also informs you of current index activity, which may be none if no indexing is being performed, or a indexer thread id and an expected time of completion if there is an index operation in progress. The final information item in this block is the state of the index and the index queue.</li>
<li>
<strong>Master Control Records</strong> informs you of the state of any global commands in the index queue. </li>
<li>
<strong>Site Control Records</strong> informs you of the state of any work site control records in the index queue. This will include commands from sites other than the ones that you maintain.</li>
<li>
<strong>Index Workers</strong> provides a list of all indexer threads in the Sakai cluster. In this list is the ID of the thread, the last time a heartbeat was received, and the current state of the thread, either idle or running. If the thread its ID will be present in the first information block with an estimated time of completion.</li>
<li>Finally there is a block of information about the search index segments that are used by the search engine to store its state.</li>

<ol>
<li>Global commands that control the whole search engine.</li>
<li>Site wide commands that control the search engine in the context of the current site.</li>
<li>Document commands that inform the search engine of items to be added or removed from the index.</li>

<p>Only instance administrators are allowed to perform Global operations. These operations are, rebuild, refresh and release lock. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Rebuild</strong> <strong>Whole Index</strong> deletes the entire index, and requests that all tools in the system resubmit all content to the search engine for re-indexing. This operation should only be performed with caution, since a large site may take several hours to complete this operation. </li>
<li>
<strong>Refresh Whole Index</strong> is only sightly more drastic as it takes all the content known to the search engine, and refreshed the index. While this command is being enacted upon by the indexer threads, the search index will still contain all of the content. </li>
<li>
<strong>Remove Lock</strong> should only be issued if the operator is certain that the indexer thread that is supposed to be performing the current index operation has died. This should almost never be necessary, as each indexer thread emits a heartbeat to the cluster that conforms its health. If any indexer thread that has not emitted a heartbeat, or has become overdue has a writer lock on the index, it will have that lock removed by one of the other indexer threads, which will allow one of the other indexer threads to recover the indexing operation.</li>
