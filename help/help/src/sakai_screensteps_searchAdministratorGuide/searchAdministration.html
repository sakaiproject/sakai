<li>The first block of information informs you when the index was last loaded by the Index Searcher on the cluster node you are connected to. It also informs you of current index activity, which may be none if no indexing is being performed, or a indexer thread id and an expected time of completion if there is an index operation in progress. The final information item in this block is the state of the index and the index queue.</li>
<li>
<strong>Master Control Records</strong> informs you of the state of any global commands in the index queue. </li>
<li>
<strong>Site Control Records</strong> informs you of the state of any work site control records in the index queue. This will include commands from sites other than the ones that you maintain.</li>
<li>
<strong>Index Workers</strong> provides a list of all indexer threads in the Sakai cluster. In this list is the ID of the thread, the last time a heartbeat was received, and the current state of the thread, either idle or running. If the thread its ID will be present in the first information block with an estimated time of completion.</li>
<li>Finally there is a block of information about the search index segments that are used by the search engine to store its state.</li>
