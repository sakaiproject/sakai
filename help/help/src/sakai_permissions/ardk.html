<h2>Changing
permissions for a tool in a course or a project site</h2> 

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this
document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a
basic understanding of roles and permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>Permissions are generally granted for a tool, rather than for a particular
item created by using a tool. For example, permissions are set for the
Announcement tool, rather than for individual announcements.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In Resources/Drop Box, you can set permissions for
all resources and for folders of resources. In Forums, you can set permissions for individual forums and topics; you can also edit the permissions in the default template that will apply to any new forums or topics.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Resources and Drop Box tools share the same permissions set; permissions for both are set in Resources.  Similarly, Gradebook and [document unavailable: axxo] share the same permissions set, which is set in Gradebook. </p>







<p>Most tools that contain individual instructor-created items, such as Announcements or Calendar, have permission settings that you can modify as described below.  In addition to the exceptions noted above, some tools, including Syllabus and Messages, do not allow you to modify permissions.</p>


<p>To change permissions for most tools that allow permission editing:</p>

<ol><li>Open the site by clicking its tab.  <br /><br /> 
</li><li>In the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>, click the tool for which you want to
set permissions.  <br /><br /> 
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Permissions</code></strong> or <strong><code>Permission Settings</code></strong> at the top of the main window.
<br /><br /> 
</li><li>Check or uncheck the boxes to grant or deny the permissions.
<br /><br />
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Save</code></strong>.</li></ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must exit the permissions feature by
clicking <strong><code>Save</code></strong> or <strong><code>Cancel</code></strong> before you can set
permissions in another tool.</p>

<p>Each tool has a different set of available permissions. For a general
idea of the permissions available, see the following list of
permissions for the Schedule tool:</p>

<ul><li><strong>new</strong> Create a new item
</li><li><strong>delete.any</strong> Delete any item
</li><li><strong>delete.own</strong> Delete own items
</li><li><strong>revise.any</strong> Revise any item
</li><li><strong>revise.own</strong> Revise own items
</li><li><strong>import</strong> Import an item
</li><li><strong>read</strong> Read an item
</li><li><strong>all.groups</strong> See postings associated with any group</li></ul>
