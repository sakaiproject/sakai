  <p>Course grade calculations depend on your <em>Gradebook</em>'s organization and grade entry setting, points (described here) or percentages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>No categories (default) </strong>- Each Gradebook item is assigned a simple point value. The course grade is determined by the student's total score divided by the total points possible.</li>
<li>
<strong>Categories only</strong> - Categories are used to group Gradebook items, where items are assigned a simple point or percentage value.  Similar to a gradebook with <strong>No categories</strong>, the course grade is determined by the student's total score divided by the total points possible. This structure provides the option to drop the lowest grade(s), keep the highest grade(s), or drop the highest grade(s) within a category.</li>
<li>
<strong>Categories and weighting</strong>- Items are grouped into categories, where each category is assigned a percentage of the course grade.  The total score of all items in a category will comprise the category's percentage of the course grade. This structure provides the option to drop the lowest grade(s), keep the highest grade(s), or drop the highest grade(s) within a category.</li>
</ul>

      <div class="step-instructions screensteps-textblock">
  <p>In a default gradebook with <strong>No categories</strong>, course grades are calculated for each student by dividing the sum of the scores received for all graded items by the total points possible for those items.</p>
<p>In the example pictured above, Student Five earned a total of 72 points out of 80 total points possible. This student's course grade is 72/80 = 0.90 (90%).</p>
</div>
 
      <div class="step-instructions screensteps-textblock">
  <p><em>Note: <strong>Ungraded</strong> items are <strong>not included</strong> in a student's course grade. Leaving a grade entry blank reduces the total points possible by the point value of the ungraded item for that student.</em></p>
<p><em>In the example pictured above, most students were graded out of <strong>80</strong> total points. However, Student Three has not received a grade for Homework 2 (10 points possible).  Thus, this student's course grade is 59/<strong>70</strong> = 0.8429 (84.29%).</em></p>

    <h2 class="step-title screensteps-heading">Categories Only</h2>
      <div class="step-instructions screensteps-textblock">
  <p>With <strong>Categories only</strong>, course grades are calculated the same as in a gradebook with <strong>No categories</strong> (described above). However, if all items in a category have the same total point value, you can automatically drop the lowest or highest grades or keep the highest grades within that category. Dropped grades are omitted from the course grade calculation, and the total points possible in the category are reduced by the point value(s) of the omitted item(s).</p>
<p>By using the <strong>Keep Highest</strong> option instead of the <strong>Drop Lowest</strong> to drop the lowest grade(s), no grades will be dropped in the category until the number of items kept is exceeded.</p>
<p>See below for example calculations when grades in a category are dropped or kept.</p>
</div>
 
      <div class="step-instructions screensteps-textblock">
  <p><em>Note: You must assign each item to a category for the item to be included in students' course grades.</em></p>
<p><em>Grades can only be entered in Gradebook items; you cannot enter grades into a category with no items.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Ungraded</strong> items are <strong>not included</strong> in a student's course grade.  Leaving a grade entry blank reduces the total points possible by the point value of the ungraded item for that student.</em></p>

  <p>Pictured above is a gradebook with two categories: <strong>Assignments</strong> and <strong>Quizzes</strong>. The <strong>Assignments</strong> category drops the lowest grade, and includes two assignments, each worth 10 points. The <strong>Quizzes</strong> category includes <strong>Quiz 1</strong> (10 points) and <strong>Quiz 2</strong> (20 points).  There are <strong>40 points</strong> possible because only one assignment and the two quiz grades are included in the course grade calculation.</p>
<p>In our example, <strong>Student Five</strong> received the following grades:</p>
<p><strong>Assignments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Assignment 1</strong> (10 points)</li>
<li><em><strong>Assignment 2</strong> (8 points) (lowest grade - dropped)</em></li>

<p>Since the <strong>Assignment 2</strong> grade is dropped for Student Five, his course grade is <strong>95%</strong>:</p>

  <p>Before the third assignment grade is entered, <strong>Student Five</strong> received the following grades:</p>

<p>In comparison, if <strong>Drop Lowest</strong> were used instead, Student Five's grade would have been calculated as only 36 points earned out of 40 points (<strong>95%</strong>), as shown in the example above where the lowest grade of two assignment is dropped. </p>

  <p>Now we enter the third assignment grade. The highest two assignment grades are kept, so the lowest assignment grade (<strong>Assignment 3</strong>) is dropped:</p>
<p><strong>Assignments:</strong></p>

<li>

<p>Student Five's grade is still <strong>92%</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 + 8 + 9 + 19 = 46 points earned</li>
<li>46/50 = 0.92</li>
</ul>
<p>Keeping the highest grades instead of dropping the lowest grades ensures that Student Five's grade is calculated out of the same number of total points (<strong>50 points</strong>) both before and after entering the third assignment grade.</p>
<p>If the <strong>Drop Lowest</strong> option had been used instead, the calculated course grade for Student Five would have been calculated out of <strong>40 points </strong>before entering the third assignment grade. The course grade would have decreased significantly after the third assignment grade was entered, going from an <strong>A</strong> (<strong>95%</strong>) down to an <strong>A-</strong> (<strong>92%</strong>).</p>
