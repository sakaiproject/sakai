  <p>There are many options for setting up your Gradebook in Sakai. Most gradebooks fall into one of the following types. Examples of each scenario are provided to help you determine which setup option is the best match for your course.</p>
</div>

      <div class="step screensteps-section screensteps-depth-1" id="simple-points-based-gradebook">
    <h2 class="step-title screensteps-heading">Simple Points-Based Gradebook</h2>
      <div class="step-instructions screensteps-textblock">
  <p>This type of Gradebook is a simple calculation of total points. The point value for each item is added up and the total points reflect the cumulative student grade for the course.</p>
<p>For more information on this scenario, see the related articleÂ <a href="content.hlp?docId=howdoisetupasimplepointsbasedgradebook">How do I set up a simple points-based Gradebook?</a></p>

      <div class="step screensteps-section screensteps-depth-1" id="gradebook-with-categories-for-organization-and-or-dropping-grades">
    <h2 class="step-title screensteps-heading">Gradebook with Categories for Organization and/or Dropping Grades</h2>
      <div class="step-instructions screensteps-textblock">
  <p>This type of Gradebook uses categories to organize items into groups. For example, you might group all of the assignments into one category, all of the quizzes into another category, and so on. Optionally, once categories have been set up, you have the ability to drop the lowest or keep the highest grades within a category.</p>

      <div class="step screensteps-section screensteps-depth-1" id="gradebook-with-weighted-categories">
    <h2 class="step-title screensteps-heading">Gradebook with Weighted Categories</h2>
      <div class="step-instructions screensteps-textblock">
  <p>This type of Gradebook uses categories as well as weighting. For example, you might have an discussion category worth 20% of the grade, an assignments category worth 40% of the grade, and a quizzes category worth 40% of the grade.</p>
