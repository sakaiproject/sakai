<p>Each site has an automatically generated site email address, which you
can view in the <strong>Email Archive</strong> feature. Email sent to the site
email address is copied to all site participants and owners.</p>

<p>All messages sent to your site's email address are stored in the
<strong>Email Archive</strong>.  The email sent to site participants will
indicate if there was an attachment, and will provide a link to get
the attachment from the worksite itself.</p>

<p>Members of the group can choose how often they want to receive email
sent to the site's email address in the <strong>Preferences</strong> feature
in <strong>My Workspace</strong>.</p>



<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p>Site owners can create an easy-to-remember alias for the site's email
address.</p>


<h3>Things to know</h3>
<p>Instructors can use Email Archive to automatically update email groups
for course sites. As students drop or add the course, they
will be dropped or added from the email group appropriately.</p>

<p>Users who participate in more than one site can choose to
receive email either as it is sent, or in digest mode, with all posts
for the day sent in a single email message.</p>

<p> Messages can be sent from any email program
to the email address listed at the top of your <strong>Email Archive</strong>
page.</p>

<p>Clicking a column header (<strong>From</strong>, <strong>Subject</strong> or
<strong>Sent</strong>) will sort the messages by that header.</p>

<p>When sorting by subject, clicking the up arrow will arrange the
messages alphabetically. When sorting by date received, clicking the
up arrow will order the messages from most recent to oldest. In both
cases, clicking the down arrow reverses the order.</p>
