  <p dir="ltr">If you would like to post an answer to a question, select that question in the left-hand topics list. </p>
<p dir="ltr">If the question has not yet been answered, select <strong>Answer</strong> <strong>this question</strong>. </p>
<p dir="ltr">If you would like to add an answer to a question that already has responses, scroll to the bottom of the responses and select <strong>Add an answer</strong>. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Enter your answer in the text box that appears. If you would like only the person who posted the question (and the instructor, if they weren’t the original author) to see your response, you can check the box next to <strong>Private</strong> below the text entry box. If the author of the question enabled anonymous responses, you will see an option to make your answer anonymous below the text entry box as well. Select <strong>Save as Draft </strong>if you would like to revise it further before posting. Your draft will be displayed under the question, with a bolded notation of draft at the top of the post. </p>
