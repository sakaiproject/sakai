<p>Discussion allows structured conversations that are organized into
categories. Site participants can post replies to a topic (a "flat"
discussion) or to other replies (a "threaded" discussion). The site
owner can also choose whether or not to allow site participants to
post their own discussion topics.
</p><p>You may view Discussion in a row or column layout. This is a personal
preference and changes only your view of the Discussion.
</p><h3>Key concepts</h3>

<h4>Viewing the list of Discussion categories and topics</h4>
<p>When you click <strong>Discussion</strong> in the menubar, you will see a
list. Under each category, you'll see any topics and responses that
have been added. To view just the categories, click <strong>Collapse
All</strong>. To view the categories and all the topics and responses,
click <strong>Expand All</strong>.
</p><p>The small paper stack icon will expand the view so that a top-level
item and all the responses below it are visible. The small trash can
symbol next to a discussion item will delete that item if clicked.
Only instructors and users with special permissions can delete
discussion items.</p>

<h4>Layout options</h4>

<p>The Discussion tool uses two frames to display discussion topics and
replies. The layout can be changed to a vertical (two column) or
horizontal (two row) layout by using the <strong>View</strong> drop-down
menu. In the vertical layout (the two column layout), the left frame
shows the hierarchy of categories, topics, and replies. Clicking a
topic or reply shows the content of the message in the right frame. To
respond to a topic or reply, click the <strong>Reply</strong> button at the
bottom of the content window. The content window is the right frame in
the two column layout, and the bottom frame in the two row layout.
</p><h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>When posting a topic in the Discussion area, instructors have the
ability to specify whether they wish to allow students to respond only
to that topic or to any topic posted. If you allow postings only to
the topics you specify, then you create a "flat" discussion. If, on
the other hand, you allow replies to any posting, then you create a
"threaded" discussion. Threaded discussions are by nature more
interactive because users are able to reply to a reply. Flat
discussions, in contrast, tend to be more structured and for this
reason are more easily controlled.

</li><li>Many collaboration sites allow any site participant to start a
discussion topic, which facilitates a more collegial discussion
environment.

Review" to structure their Discussion feature. Others create
categories for course concepts.</li></ul>
