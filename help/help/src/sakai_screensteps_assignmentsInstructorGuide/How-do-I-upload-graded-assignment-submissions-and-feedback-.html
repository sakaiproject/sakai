<p><em>Note: The archive file needs to be in a specific format. It should contain a folder for the assignment and subfolders for each of the individual students.

<p>If you have previously extracted the bulk_download.zip file on your computer, and then edited or added to the assignment grades or feedback, you will need to create a new archive or zip file for upload which includes your changes. </p>
<p>You can create a zip file from a folder in Windows by right-clicking on the folder, and then selecting <strong>Send to</strong> and <strong>Compressed (zipped) folder</strong>. The zip file will have the same name as the folder you selected.</p>
<p><em>Tip: You can either compress/zip all existing assignment folders at once for upload, or just one assignment folder at a time.</em></p>
