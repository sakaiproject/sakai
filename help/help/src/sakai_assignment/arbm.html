<h2>Completing and submitting an
assignment</h2><p>Your instructor or project leader may set up assignments for you to
complete and submit online. To work on an assignment, follow these
steps:</p>

<ol><li>Open the site for the course or project with the assignment.

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>, click <strong><code>Assignments</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Click the name of the assignment to open it.

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> The assignment must have a status of "open" for
you to be able to work on it.
</p>
</li><li>To work on the assignment, follow the instructions from your
instructor or project leader. You may need to type something into the
text box, or perhaps add an attachment, or both.

<br /><br />
</li><li>To add an attachment, click the <strong><code>Add Attachments</code></strong> button in
the assignment window. In the window that appears, you have several
options:

<br /><br />

<ul><li>To attach a local file from your computer, under <strong><code>Items to
attach</code></strong>, type the filename in the box provided, or browse for the
file, select it, and click <strong><code>Browse</code></strong>. A small icon representing
the item will appear above, under <strong><code>Items to attach</code></strong>.
</li><li>To attach a website URL, under <strong><code>URL (link to website)</code></strong>,
type the URL in the box provided. You can omit the
<code>http://</code> (for example,
<code>www.google.com</code>). Then click <strong><code>Add</code></strong>. 
</li><li>To attach an item from the resources already in this course
website, under <strong><code>Select a resource</code></strong>, click 
<strong><code>Attach a copy</code></strong> next to the appropriate resource.  

</li><li>When you are done adding attachments, click <strong><code>Finish</code></strong>.
</li></ul>

<br />
</li><li>If you'd like to see how your assignment will look to your
instructor or project leader, click <strong><code>Preview</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>If you want to save your assignment to complete later, click
<strong><code>Save Draft</code></strong> at the bottom of the screen. When you want to
reopen it, you'll find it listed in the assignment list with a status
of "In progress".

<br />
<br />
</li><li>To submit an assignment when you have finished, click the
<strong><code>Done</code></strong> button at the bottom of the screen.
