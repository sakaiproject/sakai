<h3>Create/add a new assignment</h3>

<p>To create/add a new assignment, follow these steps:</p>

<ol><li>In the <a href="/portal/help/TOCDisplay/content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>, click <strong><code>Assignments</code></strong>, and then
click <strong><code>New Assignment</code></strong> at the top of the page.

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the web form that opens, fill in the following information
(fields marked with a red dot are required):

<br /><br />

<ul><li><strong>Title:</strong> Enter a brief title for your assignment,
e.g., <code>Essay 1 </code>. 

</li><li><strong>Open date:</strong> At the open date and time, the
assignment is available for students to begin working on it. To send
an announcement alerting students to the start date, see step 4 below.
</li><li><strong>Due date:</strong> This is the assignment's deadline. To
list the due date on the course site's schedule, see step 4
below.
</li><li><strong>Accept until:</strong> No assignments can be
submitted after this date. You can set this date and time later than
the due date to continue accepting assignments (e.g., to allow for
revisions) after the due date.
</li><li><strong>Student submissions:</strong> You can choose to have
students submit their assignments inline only (typed directly into a
text box), as attachments only, or both.
</li><li><strong>Grade scale:</strong> There are five grading options you
can choose from: <strong><code>Ungraded</code></strong>, <strong><code>Letter grade</code></strong>,
<strong><code>Points</code></strong>, <strong><code>Pass/Fail</code></strong>, or <strong><code>Checkmark</code></strong>. If you
choose points, enter the maximum possible points (must be a positive
number or zero).
</li><li><strong>Additional resources:</strong> To add an attached resource
to your assignment, follow these steps:

<br /><br />


</li></ul><br />
</li><li>In the "Assignment Instructions" box, type a description of the
assignment.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This step is optional, but you will receive an
alert message at the top of the page when you post the assignment if
you leave it blank.  Click <strong><code>Post</code></strong> a second time to proceed.</p>
</li><li>Under the text box for Assignment Instructions, you will see three
options, as follows:

<br /><br />

<ul><li><strong><code>Add due date to schedule:</code></strong>
To add the due date to the site's schedule, check the box.
</li><li><strong><code>Announce the open date:</code></strong>To announce the open date
automatically when you post the assignment with an announcement on
your site's homepage, check the box.
</li><li><strong><code>Add honor pledge:</code></strong> To display the honor pledge when
students are submitting an assignment, check the box. Students must
check a checkbox agreeing to the pledge before their work can be
submitted. The text of the honor pledge is as follows:

<blockquote><p>"I have neither given nor received aid on this assignment. Yes (You
must respond to submit your assignment.)"</p></blockquote>
</li></ul>
</li></ol>

assignment.</p>
