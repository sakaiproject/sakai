<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>For courses, the Assignments tool allows instructors to create,
distribute, collect, and grade online assignments. Assignments are
private; student submissions are not visible to other users of the
site.
</p><p>The Assignments tool offers multiple grading options, including letter
grades, points, check marks, pass/fail, or ungraded.
</p><p>Assignments can also be returned, with or without grades, for
re-submission. Instructors can download all submissions to an
assignment to their computer at once. When instructors release grades
for an assignment, students can access instructor comments and their
grades.
</p><h3>Key concepts</h3>

<h4>Student view</h4>

As an instructor, you can view the assignments you create in student
view so that you see what a student would see. To do so:
<ol><li>From the menubar, click <strong>Assignments</strong>.  

<br clear="none"/><br clear="none"/> 
</li><li>From the <strong>Assignments</strong> menu, select <strong>Student View</strong>.


<br clear="none"/><br clear="none"/> 
</li><li>Click an assignment to see it in student view.  

<br clear="none"/><br clear="none"/>
</li><li>Click <strong>Done</strong> to return to the assignment list. To return to
instructor view, from the <strong>Assignments</strong> menu, select
<strong>Assignment List</strong>.</li></ol>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>
<ul><li>Instructors can return assignments and allow for
re-submission. This feature can be used to evaluate drafts of final
projects or papers, or to allow students to correct and re-submit an
assignment.</li></ul>
