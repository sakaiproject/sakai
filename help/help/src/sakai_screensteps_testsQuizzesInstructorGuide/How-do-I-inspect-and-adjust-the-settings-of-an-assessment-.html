<p>You can also decide how much feedback you want to release to students. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>You can choose to <strong>Only Release Student's Assessment Scores </strong>so that they only see their grade on the assessment, not individual questions. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Or, you can choose to <strong>Release Question and the following </strong>and then select the items that you want students to see from the list below. &nbsp;Check the box next to any items you want students to see. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Tip: &nbsp;If you are concerned about students sharing their exam results with one another, you should choose either </em><em><strong>No Feedback </strong></em><em>or </em><em><strong>Feedback on a specific date</strong></em><em>. &nbsp;For the latter, selecting a date after the closing date for the assessment will prevent students from sharing feedback with other students who have not yet taken the test.</em></p>
