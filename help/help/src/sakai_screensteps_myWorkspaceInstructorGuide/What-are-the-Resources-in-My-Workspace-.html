        <p>Resources are available in both My Workspace and course sites. The Resources tool is site-dependent; the content uploaded in the My Workspace area is private and visible only to the user (unless the user chooses to make items public). </p>
<p>The Resources tool in My Workspace serves as a personal file space for the user to save, store, and organize files. </p>
<p>The features and functionality of the Resources tool are the same in any site where the tool appears. Please refer to <a href="content.hlp?docId=whatistheResourcestool">What is the Resources tool?</a> for more information on how to manage files using this tool.</p>
<p><em>Note: Your institution may limit the user file storage quota and/or access to Resources in My Workspace.</em></p>
