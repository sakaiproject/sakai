<h2>How to navigate</h2>
<p>
Following is a brief overview of features and how to navigate:
</p>

<ul><li><a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My Workspace</a> is your individual online workspace. When
you first log in, you go to My Workspace automatically. To return to
your workspace after visiting other sites, click <strong><code>My Workspace</code></strong>
in the upper left corner of the screen.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Course and <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardt">project sites</a> appear as tabs across the top
of the screen. Click a
tab to go to the corresponding site. Course sites are associated with
courses; project sites are for projects and other collaborative
activities.

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> If you are not yet a member of any course or
project site, you will see only a My Workspace tab. For information
about joining sites, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arel">Membership: Overview</a>.
</p>
</li><li>The <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> is a customizable column along the left
side of the screen with links for each available tool (e.g.,
<strong><code>Announcements</code></strong>, <strong><code>Discussion</code></strong>). The number of links will
vary depending on which tools were chosen for a site. Click the tool's
name to go to the corresponding tool.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong><code>Home</code></strong> on the menubar takes you to the homepage for the
site you're in. Homepages can contain a list of recent announcements,
recent discussion items, and selected resources.

<br /><br />
</li><li>When you're using a tool, the reset button, which is located to
the left of the tool's name, will take you back to the first page of
that tool, and will reset the tool.
</li></ul>
