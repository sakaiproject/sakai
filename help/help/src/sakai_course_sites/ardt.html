<h2>Course and project sites: Overview</h2>

<h3>What they are</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Course sites:</strong> A course site is the official work
site for a particular academic course for an institution and can be
linked to a database (such as a registrar's) to
automatically populate its roster.<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Project sites:</strong> Project sites are designed to
facilitate collaboration. You can invite anyone you wish to join your
project site.


</li></ul>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Customization:</strong> Using a web
browser, you can choose from features and functions to
create course and project sites that meet your needs. Here are
some examples:</p>

<ul><li>A course web site where students can work on and submit assignments<br /><br />
</li><li>A web site where an instructor or project director can make
announcements and share resources, such as documents or links to other
web sites<br /><br />
</li><li>A web site that serves as an online discussion board
</li></ul>

<p><strong>My Workspace:</strong> When you log in, you will
automatically open a site called <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My Workspace</a>. All users
get their own My Workspace site.</p>

<p><strong>Tabs:</strong> When you log in, the course and <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardt">project
sites</a> to which you belong are displayed as tabs across the top
of the screen. To enter a site, click its tab. If you belong to more
sites than can be displayed as tabs, those sites are accessible
from the <strong><code>- more -</code></strong> drop-down list.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can choose to hide sites (e.g., course
sites from previous semesters) or reorder them (i.e., choose which
sites to display in tabs) using the Preferences tool in <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My
Workspace</a>. For instructions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arox">Showing, hiding, and ordering course and project sites</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Menubar:</strong> Course sites and project sites
can have just a few or several functions (including announcements, a
schedule, an online discussion
area, assignments, electronic resources, a chat area, and more). When
you create a site, you choose which tools to include, and they are
added to the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> along the left side of the screen. To
access a tool, click its name in the menubar. Sites also have a
"home page", which you can access by clicking <strong><code>Home</code></strong> in the
menubar.</p>
