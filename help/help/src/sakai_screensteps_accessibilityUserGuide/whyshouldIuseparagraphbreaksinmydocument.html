  <p>A <em>paragraph break</em> (hitting <strong>Enter</strong> or <strong>Return</strong> on the keyboard) is always more meaningful than a <em>line break</em> (hitting <strong>Shift</strong> + <strong>Enter</strong> or <strong>Return</strong> on the keyboard). A <em>paragraph break</em> inserts what looks like a double-space between one line of text and another, and it allows screen reader users to parse the information on the page more readily.</p>
<p>Although programs like Microsoft Word have options to create single-spaced documents with paragraph breaks, web pages do not.Â You may find using a line break more aesthetically pleasing than a paragraph break, but line breaks can create problems for screen reader users.</p>
<p>While a screen reader can interpret a paragraph break as "blank," a line break may not be indicated to the user. The text on the new line may sound like a new sentence, instead of the start of a new paragraph.</p>

<li>The first image above depicts a poem, <em>Mary Had a Little Lamb</em>, where line breaks were used to separate each line.</li>
<li>In the second image, paragraph breaks separate the lines.</li>
</ol>
<p>While the line breaks may "look better" for a visual reader, a screen reader user will hear the poem that is split up with line breaks as one contiguous sentence: "Mary had a little lamb, his fleece was white as snow, etc." </p>
