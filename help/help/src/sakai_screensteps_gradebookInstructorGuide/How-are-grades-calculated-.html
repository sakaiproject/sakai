        <p>The Gradebook automatically calculates a course grade based on the number of points scored out of the total points submitted (i.e., a running grade). Ungraded items will not be included in the course grade calculation, so the course grade will not necessarily reflect the student's true score. To include ungraded items in the course grade calculation, you need to enter a 0 (zero) for those items.</p>
<p>To exclude a gradebook item from the course grade, you can edit the gradebook item and deselect<strong> Include this item in course grade calculations</strong>. The score for that item will appear in parentheses to indicate that it is not included in the course grade calculation.</p>
<p>Extra credit points are excluded from the total possible points available, but included in student grade calculations for points awarded. See <a href="content.hlp?docId=howdoesextracreditwork">How does extra credit work?</a> for more information on extra credit gradebook items and categories.</p>
<p><em>Note: Students can't see their grades for an item unless you select</em><em><strong> Release this item to students</strong></em><em> when editing the gradebook item.</em></p>

<p>On the other hand, if you have weighted categories in your gradebook, the calculation is a little more complex. First, all of the items within each category are averaged, taking the total points awarded within the category, and dividing that by the total possible points within the category. Then, all category averages are multiplied by the category weighting and added together to determine the final score. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The example below shows the grade for an individual student in a weighted gradebook with three categories: Assignments (50% of course grade), Discussions (20% of course grade), and Quizzes (30% of course grade).</p>

<p>In this example, demostudent01 has not received a score for Assignment 3, Module 02 Quiz, or Module 03 Quiz. Those three items and their associated possible points are automatically excluded from the grade calculation. Therefore, the grade is calculated as follows:</p>
<p>Average within each category = total of awarded points divided by total possible points</p>
<ul>
<li>Assignments = (80 + 90) / 200 = 0.85 or 85%</li>
