<p>cron is a UNIX tool that has been around for a long time, so its scheduling capabilities are powerful and proven. The CronTrigger class is based on the scheduling capabilities of cron.</p>
<p>CronTrigger uses &ldquo;cron expressions&rdquo;, which are able to create firing schedules such as: &ldquo;At 8:00am every Monday through Friday&rdquo; or &ldquo;At 1:30am every last Friday of the month&rdquo;.</p>

<p>A cron expression is a string comprised of 6 or 7 fields separated by white space. Fields can contain any of the allowed values, along with various combinations of the allowed special characters for that field. The fields are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Field Name	Mandatory	Allowed Values	Allowed Special Characters</strong></p>
<p>Seconds	YES	0-59	, - * /</p>
<p>Minutes	YES	0-59	, - * /</p>
<p>Hours	YES	0-23	, - * /</p>
<p>Day of month	YES	1-31	, - * ? / L W</p>
<p>Month	YES	1-12 or JAN-DEC	, - * /</p>
<p>Day of week	YES	1-7 or SUN-SAT	, - * ? / L #</p>
<p>Year	NO	empty, 1970-2099	, - * /</p>
<p>So cron expressions can be as simple as this: * * * * ? *</p>
<p>or more complex, like this: 0/5 14,18,3-39,52 * ? JAN,MAR,SEP MON-FRI 2002-2010</p>

<p>* (&ldquo;all values&rdquo;) - used to select all values within a field. For example, &ldquo;*&rdquo; in the minute field means &ldquo;every minute&rdquo;.</p>
<p>? (&ldquo;no specific value&rdquo;) - useful when you need to specify something in one of the two fields in which the character is allowed, but not the other. For example, if I want my trigger to fire on a particular day of the month (say, the 10th), but don&rsquo;t care what day of the week that happens to be, I would put &ldquo;10&rdquo; in the day-of-month field, and &ldquo;?&rdquo; in the day-of-week field. See the examples below for clarification.</p>
<p>- - used to specify ranges. For example, &ldquo;10-12&rdquo; in the hour field means &ldquo;the hours 10, 11 and 12&rdquo;.</p>
<p>, - used to specify additional values. For example, &ldquo;MON,WED,FRI&rdquo; in the day-of-week field means &ldquo;the days Monday, Wednesday, and Friday&rdquo;.</p>
<p>/ - used to specify increments. For example, &ldquo;0/15&rdquo; in the seconds field means &ldquo;the seconds 0, 15, 30, and 45&rdquo;. And &ldquo;5/15&rdquo; in the seconds field means &ldquo;the seconds 5, 20, 35, and 50&rdquo;. You can also specify &lsquo;/&rsquo; after the &lsquo;&rsquo; character - in this case &lsquo;&rsquo; is equivalent to having &lsquo;0&rsquo; before the &lsquo;/&rsquo;. &lsquo;1/3&rsquo; in the day-of-month field means &ldquo;fire every 3 days starting on the first day of the month&rdquo;.</p>
<p>L (&ldquo;last&rdquo;) - has different meaning in each of the two fields in which it is allowed. For example, the value &ldquo;L&rdquo; in the day-of-month field means &ldquo;the last day of the month&rdquo; - day 31 for January, day 28 for February on non-leap years. If used in the day-of-week field by itself, it simply means &ldquo;7&rdquo; or &ldquo;SAT&rdquo;. But if used in the day-of-week field after another value, it means &ldquo;the last xxx day of the month&rdquo; - for example &ldquo;6L&rdquo; means &ldquo;the last friday of the month&rdquo;. You can also specify an offset from the last day of the month, such as &ldquo;L-3&rdquo; which would mean the third-to-last day of the calendar month. When using the &lsquo;L&rsquo; option, it is important not to specify lists, or ranges of values, as you&rsquo;ll get confusing/unexpected results.</p>
<p>W (&ldquo;weekday&rdquo;) - used to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest the given day. As an example, if you were to specify &ldquo;15W&rdquo; as the value for the day-of-month field, the meaning is: &ldquo;the nearest weekday to the 15th of the month&rdquo;. So if the 15th is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Friday the 14th. If the 15th is a Sunday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 16th. If the 15th is a Tuesday, then it will fire on Tuesday the 15th. However if you specify &ldquo;1W&rdquo; as the value for day-of-month, and the 1st is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 3rd, as it will not &lsquo;jump&rsquo; over the boundary of a month&rsquo;s days. The &lsquo;W&rsquo; character can only be specified when the day-of-month is a single day, not a range or list of days.</p>
<p>The 'L' and 'W' characters can also be combined in the day-of-month field to yield 'LW', which translates to *"last weekday of the month"*.</p>
<p># - used to specify &ldquo;the nth&rdquo; XXX day of the month. For example, the value of &ldquo;6#3&rdquo; in the day-of-week field means &ldquo;the third Friday of the month&rdquo; (day 6 = Friday and &ldquo;#3&rdquo; = the 3rd one in the month). Other examples: &ldquo;2#1&rdquo; = the first Monday of the month and &ldquo;4#5&rdquo; = the fifth Wednesday of the month. Note that if you specify &ldquo;#5&rdquo; and there is not 5 of the given day-of-week in the month, then no firing will occur that month.</p>
<p>The legal characters and the names of months and days of the week are not case sensitive. MON is the same as mon.</p>

<p>0 11 11 11 11 ?	Fire every November 11th at 11:11am.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the effects of '?' and '*' in the day-of-week and day-of-month fields!</p>
