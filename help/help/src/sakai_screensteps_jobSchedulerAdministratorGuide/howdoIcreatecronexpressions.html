  <p>cron is a UNIX tool that has been around for a long time, so its scheduling capabilities are powerful and proven. The CronTrigger class is based on the scheduling capabilities of cron.</p>
<p>CronTrigger uses “cron expressions”, which are able to create firing schedules such as: “At 8:00am every Monday through Friday” or “At 1:30am every last Friday of the month”.</p>

  <p>A cron expression is a string comprised of 6 or 7 fields separated by white space. Fields can contain any of the allowed values, along with various combinations of the allowed special characters for that field. The fields are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Field Name	Mandatory	Allowed Values	Allowed Special Characters</strong></p>
<p>Seconds	YES	0-59	, - * /</p>
<p>Minutes	YES	0-59	, - * /</p>
<p>Hours	YES	0-23	, - * /</p>
<p>Day of month	YES	1-31	, - * ? / L W</p>
<p>Month	YES	1-12 or JAN-DEC	, - * /</p>
<p>Day of week	YES	1-7 or SUN-SAT	, - * ? / L #</p>
<p>Year	NO	empty, 1970-2099	, - * /</p>
<p>So cron expressions can be as simple as this: * * * * ? *</p>
<p>or more complex, like this: 0/5 14,18,3-39,52 * ? JAN,MAR,SEP MON-FRI 2002-2010</p>

  <div class="step screensteps-section screensteps-depth-1" id="special-characters">
    <h2 id="special-characters" class="step-title screensteps-heading">Special characters</h2>
    
      <div class="step-instructions screensteps-textblock">
  <p>* (“all values”) - used to select all values within a field. For example, “*” in the minute field means “every minute”.</p>
<p>? (“no specific value”) - useful when you need to specify something in one of the two fields in which the character is allowed, but not the other. For example, if I want my trigger to fire on a particular day of the month (say, the 10th), but don’t care what day of the week that happens to be, I would put “10” in the day-of-month field, and “?” in the day-of-week field. See the examples below for clarification.</p>
<p>- - used to specify ranges. For example, “10-12” in the hour field means “the hours 10, 11 and 12”.</p>
<p>, - used to specify additional values. For example, “MON,WED,FRI” in the day-of-week field means “the days Monday, Wednesday, and Friday”.</p>
<p>/ - used to specify increments. For example, “0/15” in the seconds field means “the seconds 0, 15, 30, and 45”. And “5/15” in the seconds field means “the seconds 5, 20, 35, and 50”. You can also specify ‘/’ after the ‘’ character - in this case ‘’ is equivalent to having ‘0’ before the ‘/’. ‘1/3’ in the day-of-month field means “fire every 3 days starting on the first day of the month”.</p>
<p>L (“last”) - has different meaning in each of the two fields in which it is allowed. For example, the value “L” in the day-of-month field means “the last day of the month” - day 31 for January, day 28 for February on non-leap years. If used in the day-of-week field by itself, it simply means “7” or “SAT”. But if used in the day-of-week field after another value, it means “the last xxx day of the month” - for example “6L” means “the last friday of the month”. You can also specify an offset from the last day of the month, such as “L-3” which would mean the third-to-last day of the calendar month. When using the ‘L’ option, it is important not to specify lists, or ranges of values, as you’ll get confusing/unexpected results.</p>
<p>W (“weekday”) - used to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest the given day. As an example, if you were to specify “15W” as the value for the day-of-month field, the meaning is: “the nearest weekday to the 15th of the month”. So if the 15th is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Friday the 14th. If the 15th is a Sunday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 16th. If the 15th is a Tuesday, then it will fire on Tuesday the 15th. However if you specify “1W” as the value for day-of-month, and the 1st is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 3rd, as it will not ‘jump’ over the boundary of a month’s days. The ‘W’ character can only be specified when the day-of-month is a single day, not a range or list of days.</p>
<p>The 'L' and 'W' characters can also be combined in the day-of-month field to yield 'LW', which translates to *"last weekday of the month"*.</p>
<p># - used to specify “the nth” XXX day of the month. For example, the value of “6#3” in the day-of-week field means “the third Friday of the month” (day 6 = Friday and “#3” = the 3rd one in the month). Other examples: “2#1” = the first Monday of the month and “4#5” = the fifth Wednesday of the month. Note that if you specify “#5” and there is not 5 of the given day-of-week in the month, then no firing will occur that month.</p>
<p>The legal characters and the names of months and days of the week are not case sensitive. MON is the same as mon.</p>
