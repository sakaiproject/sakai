<h2>Membership: Overview</h2>
<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>In the Membership tool in <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My Workspace</a>, you can
join and unjoin
available worksites.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>My Current Sites:</strong> On the Membership tool page,
you'll see a list of all the worksites to which you belong, including
sites you have joined and sites to which you have been added as a
participant by the creator of the site.</p>

<p><strong>Joinable Sites:</strong> The <strong><code>Joinable Sites</code></strong> link will
display a listing of available sites that you haven't joined. You can
click <strong><code>Join</code></strong> for any of these sites.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>
<ul><li>By default, you will receive email notification about
announcements, email, and resources that are posted to worksites to
which you belong.

<br /><br />
</li><li>You can change your preferences so that you receive this
notification as a daily digest, or you can block these messages. For
more information, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzv">Changing notification preferences</a>.
