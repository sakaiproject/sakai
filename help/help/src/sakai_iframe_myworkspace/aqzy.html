<h2>My Workspace: Overview</h2>
<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>My Workspace is an individual online worksite that functions as a
private workspace for each user. When you log in, you will
automatically open your My Workspace, which will display the Message
of the Day and My Workspace Information boxes. By default, these boxes
contain announcements and information from the system administrator.</p>

<p>A site owner can revise what appears in the My Workspace Information
box by clicking <strong><code>Options</code></strong>. Only a system administrator can
modify the contents of the Message of the Day box, but a site owner
can click <strong><code>Options</code></strong> to customize how announcements will display
in the window.</p>
