<h2>What to do if you click your browser's Back
button</h2>


<p>The application is designed to function independently of your
browser buttons. If you change your mind about a task, such
as posting a syllabus or a resource item, you need to rely on the
buttons within the application to cancel the action instead of your
browser's <strong><code>Back</code></strong> button.</p>

<p>
If you click the <strong><code>Back</code></strong> button before completing a task, then
the next time you try to use that tool you may return to the
uncompleted task; if this happens, you will need to click
<strong><code>Cancel</code></strong> before you can do anything else in that tool. 
</p>

<p>
Also, you might unintentionally lock yourself out by using the
<strong><code>Back</code></strong> button, so that you and other people (with equivalent
roles for the site) are unable to use the tool. If this happens, you
can try to clear the lock by clicking the reset button (the
upward-pointing arrow in the upper left corner of the tool). If this
doesn't work, log out and wait at least 20 minutes before logging back
in.</p>
