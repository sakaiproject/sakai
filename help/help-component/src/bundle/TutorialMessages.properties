#Site Navigation Page

introToSakai_sitenav.body=All sites in which you have any involvement are displayed as tabs starting with My Workspace on the left, a special site that is private to you.    Each time you log into Sakai, you will start on the Home page of your My Workspace site.\
<br/><br/>\
My Workspace usually contains several tools displayed in blocks on the home page that summarize activities in all of the courses in which you are a member.\
<br/><br/>\
If you are a member of any other sites (courses, projects, etc.), these tabs will be listed across the top as well.   You can control how many tabs appear in this display.  If there are many sites, some may be listed under "More Sites" in a drop down list.\
 <br/><br/>\
You can also click on a tab to go directly to the home page of that site.  Click on the down arrow to the right of each tab to display a list of tools in the site and navigate directly to that tool within that site.\
