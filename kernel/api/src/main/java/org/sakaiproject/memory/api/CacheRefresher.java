/**
 * WARNING: this does NOT work and will not be called when cache entries are not found
 * See https://jira.sakaiproject.org/browse/KNL-1226 for more details
 *
 * This defines a kind of listener method which will be called whenever a cache miss occurs.
 * In other words, if the cache is asked to retrieve an object by a key which does not exist
 * in the cache then this method will be called if defined for that cache. Then the returned
 * value will be returned from the lookup (or a null if no new value was found) and
 * also inserted into the cache (unless the value was null)<br/>
 * <b>WARNING:</b> This can make your cache misses very costly so you will want to be careful
 * about what you make this method actually do
 * <br/>
 * Similar to https://github.com/jsr107/jsr107spec/blob/master/src/main/java/javax/cache/integration/CacheLoader.java
 *
 * Original comment:<br/>
 * Utility API for classes that will refresh a cache entry when expired.
 *
 * @deprecated this does not work (see KNL-1226) and use of it should be removed from code OR replaced by CacheLoader
 * @see org.sakaiproject.memory.api.CacheLoader and https://jira.sakaiproject.org/browse/KNL-1226
