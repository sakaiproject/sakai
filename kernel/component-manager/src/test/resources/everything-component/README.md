# "Everything" component

This is a minimal test case of everything components can do:

 - Define beans in components.xml
 - Define beans for demo mode in components-demo.xml
 - Package bare classes for dependencies
 - Package jar dependencies

The class and jar were built from the component-manager/test-spies directory
and copied here to match the layout as from the real component packaging.
