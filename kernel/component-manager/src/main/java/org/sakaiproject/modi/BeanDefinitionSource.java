/**
 * Interface used to load bean definitions into a {@link SharedApplicationContext}.
 * <p>
 * When the context is starting, it will request bean definitions from all of its registered sources. The name here is
 * strictly informational.
 * <p>
 * This interface is used to separate the knowledge of where and how the beans are defined from the loading, enabling
 * components to be packaged differently than the traditional structure, with no requirement that the beans defined in
 * any given format. For example, it is now possible to define a component with annotations or entirely in code.
 * <p>
 * This design is used to implement the traditional launch, with base configuration, each component, and then collective
 * overrides serving as the three sources. A new component could be structured as any number of sources and, indeed, the
 * notion of a component is now largely immaterial. The beans have always been loaded into the shared context with no
 * isolation or metadata about which "component" they belong to.
 * <p>
 * For example, service beans that should be available to all webapps could now be located by annotation and registered
 * from plain jars in Tomcat's lib/ directory.
