# Test spies for testing component loading

This is a mini-project that does not build with the rest of the modules. It
compiles two classes:

 - org.sakaiproject.testspy.ClassSpy
 - org.sakaiproject.testspy.JarSpy

The testspy-1.0.0.jar has only the JarSpy.

The ClassSpy.class and testspy-1.0.0.jar were copied into the test resources
"everything-component" to have a complete test of beans loading bare classes
and from jars.
