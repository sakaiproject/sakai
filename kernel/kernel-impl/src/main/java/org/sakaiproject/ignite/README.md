# Apache Ignite (https://ignite.apache.org/)

Sakai uses Apache Ignite's project to provide a toolkit for performing mechanics
that are important when multiple nodes are installed otherwise commonly referred
to as a cluster. 

## Hibernate Second Level Caching

Caching in Hibernate is important as it improves the performance of Sakai.
Any time you can forgo a query being sent to the database will improve the speed
at which a response can be constructed and sent back to the client.

Hibernate has the notion of a first level, and a second level cache.

### First Level Cache
Hibernate attempts to wait until the end before sending updates to the database
this is known traditionally known as transaction write-behind. All of this happens
in a single database conversation/session.

### Second Level Cache
The second level cache spans multiple database conversations/sessions and pertains to
Entities. Entities are cached after having been loaded from the
database and stored in the second level cache where other sessions can use them vs
loading them from the database for a single node.

### Cluster with Individual L2 Caches
Every node in a Sakai cluster has their own individual cache which contain cached entities
that are loaded and possibly modified and then persisted. Other nodes will only become aware
of the modified entities once a ttl has expired for that entity. This causes nodes to show
different states of a given entity until entity expires from the cache it is reloaded from
the database.

### Cluster with a Distributed Cache
Add Ignite distributed memory cache as the cache provider, and we end up with a
cluster that has a synchronized second level cache among all nodes. No longer will there
be entities that are not synchronized with other nodes in the cluster. As hibernate loads
entities it is loading the entity for the all nodes and when it invalidates as a result
of changes to those entities it is doing so for all nodes in the cluster.

## Configuration

Configuring Apache Ignite is going to be based on local requirements so here we will
be covering the initial strategy but others will likely be added.

Ignite is configured out of the box for a small configuration here are the following
properties that can be used to configure ignite.

* `ignite.node` a globally unique node ID which survives node restarts. By default, this is the
  _serverId_ and is unique to each node.
* `ignite.name` a local instance name for the cluster. By default, this is the _serverName_
  and is the same for all nodes in the same Sakai Cluster. 
* `ignite.home` this configures the directory that ignite will use as it's work directory.
  It should be on the servers local disk. By default, this is _$SAKAI_HOME/ignite/serverId_ 
* `ignite.mode` this configures the node as a client or server mode. Server nodes participate
  in caching, compute execution, stream processing, etc., while client nodes provide
  the ability to connect to the servers remotely. By default, the mode is _server_.
* `ignite.address` this nodes address

  _10.1.1.100_
* `ignite.addresses` other nodes addresses and port ranges

  _10.1.1.101:49009..49019,10.1.1.102:49009..49019_
* `ignite.port` this is the starting port used to calculate the range. By default, it is 0 which
  any value in the privileged port range will cause it to atu pick a port between 49152 and 65535. 
  
  _49000_
* `ignite.range` this is the number of ports that will be used when calculating the range.

  _10_


## Cache Data Regions
Sakai configures 2 data regions one for use with spring and the other as a hibernate
second level cache.

* Spring Region - this is the default region and caches will be added to this region.
* Hibernate L2 Region - this is hibernates second level cache

```xml
<bean class="org.apache.ignite.configuration.DataRegionConfiguration">
    <property name="name" value="spring_region"/>
    <property name="initialSize" value="#{10 * 1024 * 1024}"/>
    <property name="maxSize" value="#{100 * 1024 * 1024}"/>
    <property name="pageEvictionMode" value="RANDOM_2_LRU"/>
    <property name="persistenceEnabled" value="false"/>
    <property name="metricsEnabled" value="false"/>
</bean>
<bean class="org.apache.ignite.configuration.DataRegionConfiguration">
    <property name="name" value="hibernate_l2_region"/>
    <property name="initialSize" value="#{300 * 1024 * 1024}"/>
    <property name="maxSize" value="#{600 * 1024 * 1024}"/>
    <property name="pageEvictionMode" value="RANDOM_2_LRU"/>
    <property name="persistenceEnabled" value="false"/>
    <property name="metricsEnabled" value="false"/>
</bean>
```

Here is a sample of the 2 regions from the node command:

```

## Cache Configuration

* Ignite must know about the caches that it will be managing. The caches are
  declared [here](../../../../webapp/WEB-INF/ignite-components.xml)

  There are 2 types of caches that we will be using an Atomic and a Transactional as can be
  seen in the following bean definitions:
  ```xml
  <bean id="org.sakaiproject.ignite.cache.atomic" class="org.apache.ignite.configuration.CacheConfiguration" abstract="true">
      <property name="atomicityMode" value="ATOMIC"/>
      <property name="cacheMode" value="REPLICATED"/>
      <property name="writeSynchronizationMode" value="PRIMARY_SYNC"/>
      <property name="dataRegionName" value="hibernate_l2_region"/>
      <property name="onheapCacheEnabled" value="false"/>
  </bean>

  <bean id="org.sakaiproject.ignite.cache.transactional" class="org.apache.ignite.configuration.CacheConfiguration" abstract="true">
      <property name="atomicityMode" value="TRANSACTIONAL"/>
      <property name="cacheMode" value="REPLICATED"/>
      <property name="writeSynchronizationMode" value="PRIMARY_SYNC"/>
      <property name="dataRegionName" value="hibernate_l2_region"/>
      <property name="onheapCacheEnabled" value="false"/>
  </bean>
  ```
  All hibernate caches should likely use the transactional configuration as the parent.
