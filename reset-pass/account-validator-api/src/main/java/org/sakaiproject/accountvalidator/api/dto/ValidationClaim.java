 * Data Transfer Object (DTO) for account validation claim submissions.

 * wants to link their existing credentials to a validation token, allowing account merging
 * or membership transfer operations.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The typical workflow involves:</p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>User receives a validation token via email</li>
 *   <li>User accesses the validation page with the token</li>
 *   <li>User chooses to claim the account using existing credentials</li>
 *   <li>This object captures the submitted form data</li>
 *   <li>System validates credentials and merges accounts if valid</li>

 *

 * which represents the persisted validation record in the database, while ValidationClaim
 * represents transient form submission data.</p>
