<h2>Gradebook: Overview</h2>














<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>The Gradebook is a tool for instructors to calculate and store grade
information and distribute it to students online.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Features:</strong> Using the Gradebook, instructors may:</p>

<ul><li>Autocalculate course grades, with the ability to override any
letter grade

<br /><br />
</li><li>Define course letter grades based on a 100% scale

<br /><br />
</li><li>Add, view, edit, and release point values of assignments and/or
assessments to students

<br /><br />
</li><li>Enter, view, edit, and release to students scores, grades, and
comments

<br /><br />
</li><li>Transmit scores to the Gradebook from tools, such as Tests &amp;
Quizzes, thereby creating a corresponding assignment in the Gradebook
and recording student scores for that assignment.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Export scores and grades to Microsoft Excel (in <code>.xls</code>
or <code>.csv</code> format)

<br /><br />
</li><li>Import assignment scores from spreadsheet (<code>.csv</code>)
files.
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Viewing scores:</strong> The Gradebook lets students view
their own scores and grades once instructors have released them.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>Instructors can view information in the Gradebook in different
ways, including a general overview for each course, assignment detail,
course grade detail, student roster, adding or editing assignments,
and gradebook options.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Students can view their cumulative scores for all assignments and
the corresponding percentage; view their course grades, once an
instructor releases them; and sort their assignments by title, due
date, grade, and total possible points per assignment.

<br /><br />
</li><li>The Gradebook is section aware, so assistants can see grades only
for students in their particular sections.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Currently, the Gradebook does not allow you to assign extra credit
or drop the lowest score. (As a work-around, you can add an assignment
listed as extra credit.)

<br /><br />
</li><li>Instructors can import grades. For instructions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aukf">Importing scores into Gradebook</a>.
</li></ul>
