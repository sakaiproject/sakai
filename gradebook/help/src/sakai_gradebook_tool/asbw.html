<h2>Viewing and interpreting cumulative
scores</h2>










<p>In the Gradebook, both students and instructors can view current
scores.</p>

<h3>Students</h3>

<p>When you enter the Gradebook, depending on what information your
instructor has made available, you will see one or both of the
following:</p>

<ul><li><strong>A list of all the released assignments and your scores on
them:</strong> The list of assignments shows each assignment name, its
due date (if applicable), your score, and the total number of points
possible for the assignment.  <br /><br />
</li><li><strong>A "Cumulative Score" and "Course Grade":</strong> The
cumulative score shows the total points earned out of the total
available points, and the resulting percentage. The course grade is a
final grade based on assignments you have completed and assignments
still pending. Any assignments that have not been completed are
assigned zeroes automatically.

</li></ul>

<h3>Instructors</h3>

<h4>Setting score display options</h4>


<p>You may choose whether to display to students "assignment scores"
and/or "cumulative score, course grades and calculated assignment
grade".  To do so, follow the directions below:</p>

<ol><li>In the menubar of the relevant worksite, click <strong><code>Gradebook</code></strong>.
<br /><br /> 
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Grade Options</code></strong>.  <br /><br /> 
</li><li>To show students only the scores for the work they have completed
so far, check <strong><code>Display released assignment scores to
students. </code></strong>.  <br /><br />
</li><li>To show students their cumulative score, course grades, and
calculated assignment grades, check <strong><code>Display cumulative score,
course grades and calculated assignment grades to students now.
Note: A student's course grade is based on all counted
assignments. Blank score entries for counted assignments are treated
as zeroes.</code></strong>  <br /><br />


</li><li>If you want to display both
scores to students, check both boxes.</li></ol>


<h4>Viewing grades</h4>

<p>When you enter the Gradebook, you will see a list of available
assignments and a "Course Grade" list. You can view cumulative scores
using one of these options:</p>

<ul><li>Click <strong><code>Course Grade</code></strong> below the listed
assignments. You will see a list of all the students in the
Gradebook. For each student, the points earned, the letter grade, and
a percentage will be displayed. The letter grade and percentage are
based on the total points available for the entire course. A zero is
assigned automatically to all assignments that have not yet been
completed.  





<p>To view the course grade by section or
group, next to "View", select the section or group.</p>

</li><li>Click <strong><code>Roster</code></strong>. You will see a list of all the
students in the course and a point value for each assignment in the
Gradebook. To see the cumulative scores, scroll over to the last
column. No letter grade or percentage is displayed in this view.



<p>To view the roster by section
or group, next to "View", select the section or group.</p>
