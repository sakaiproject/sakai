general_instructions_prelude=In order for the questions and answers to be correctly parsed, it's crucial to distinguish between questions. To accomplish this, each question must begin with one of the following: 
general_instructions_format1=The word 'Question', followed by a number, followed by the number of points to assign enclosed in parentheses, as in 'Question 23 (10 points)'.
general_instructions_format2=The word 'Question', followed by this same parenthetical indication of points, as in 'Question (10 points)'.
general_instructions_format3=The word 'Question', followed by a number, as in 'Question 1'. In this case, zero points will be assigned to that question.
general_instructions_format4=A number, followed by a full-stop, followed by the same parenthetical indication of points to assign, as in '1. (10 points)'
general_instructions_format5=A number, followed by a full-stop, in which case zero points will be assigned to that question.
general_instructions_conclude=The text of the question itself may be placed on this same line or below it, and should be followed by answers in the appropriate format for that question type. The parser will use this format to deduce the question type of the question.
