# MC what's this link
mc_whats_this_main_text=The grading logic of multiple choice questions depends on the option you select.
mcsc_whats_this_text=This is the default option because it's the most common: students get the full point value for selecting a single correct answer and zero points for selecting anything else. This option can be further modified by selecting Enable Partial Credit or Enable Negative Grading.
mcsc_whats_this_text_no_partial_credit=This is the default option because it's the most common: students get the full point value for selecting a single correct answer and zero points for selecting anything else. If you want to penalise students for incorrect responses, then enter a value for the \"Negative point value...\" field. This value will be the question's point value when a student makes an incorrect selection. For instance, if a question is worth 10 points and you enter \"5\" into the \"Negative point value...\" field, a correct answer selection would be worth 10 points and an incorrect answer selection would be worth -5 points. 
mcss_whats_this_text=Select this option if multiple answers are correct and you would like to give students full credit for choosing <b>any</b> of them. For instance, question X has options A, B, C, D, where A, B or D are all correct answers.  If a student selects A, B or D, he would receive full credit. If he selects C, then he would get zero credit.
mcms_whats_this_text=Select this option if students need to select <b>all</b> of the correct answers in order to receive full credit. They will be given partial credit for selecting a correct answer and will be penalised for selecting an incorrect answer. For instance, question X is worth 10 points and has options A, B, C, D, E where A and B are correct choices. Each correct answer has a point value equal to the question point value divided by the number of correct answers. Thus, a student will get 5 points for selecting A or B. They will be penalised 5 points for selecting C, D or E.
mcms_whats_this_note=<b>Note: </b> Even though a question could have a negative point value based on the grading logic (as in this example), the actual lowest possible total point value for a multiple correct, multiple selection question cannot be less than zero.
enable_partial_credit_text=Select this option if you want to give students partial credit when they choose an answer that is \"almost correct.\" For instance, question X has options A, B, C, D, where A is the correct answer. If students pick A, they would receive full credit, but they could be given some credit for choosing an answer that is almost correct. Enabling this option will allow you to specify a percentage value for each answer.
enable_negative_makrinkg_text=Select this option if you want to discourage random guessing. The value entered into the \"Negative point value...\" field will be the question's point value if a student makes an incorrect selection. For instance, if a question is worth 10 points and you enter \"5\" into the \"Negative point value...\" field, a correct answer selection would be worth 10 points and an incorrect answer selection would be worth -5 points.  
enable_negative_makrinkg_note=<b>NOTE:</b> Even though a question may have a negative point value, the final point value for an assessment will not be less than zero.
reset_to_default_grading_logic_text=Click this link if you change your mind after selecting 'Enable Partial Credit' or 'Enable Negative Grading'. The default marking logic grants full credit for selecting a correct answer and zero credit for selecting an incorrect answer.
