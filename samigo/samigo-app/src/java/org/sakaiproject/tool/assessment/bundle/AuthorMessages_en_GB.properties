mc_whats_this_main_text=The grading logic of multiple choice questions depends on the option you select.
enable_partial_credit_text=Select this option if you want to give students partial credit when they choose an answer that is "almost correct." For instance, question X has options A, B, C, D, where A is the correct answer.

Enabling this option will allow you to specify a percentage value for each answer.
enable_negative_makrinkg_text=Select this option if you want to discourage random guessing. The value entered into the "Negative point value..." field will be the question's point value if a student makes an incorrect selection. For instance, if a question is worth 10 points and you enter "5" into the "Negative point value..." field, a correct answer selection would be worth 10 points and an incorrect answer selection would be worth -5 points.  
enable_negative_makrinkg_note=<b>NOTE\:</b> Even though a question may have a negative point value, the final point value for an assessment will not be less than zero.
