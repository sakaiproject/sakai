calc_question_general_instructions1=A calculated question calculates new answers for every test, based on variables whose value changes each time.  The answer is based on a formula, using those variables.
calc_question_general_instructions2=A variable definition has a name, a minimum and maximum value, and a number of decimal places.
calc_question_general_instructions3=A formula definition has a name, an mathematical expression that uses the variables, and a tolerance, so that answers within that tolerance of the answer are also considered correct.
calc_question_walkthrough_label=Steps to create a Calculated Question
calc_question_walkthrough1=Fill out the Question Text with the information that the student will see, including the variable and formula placeholders (see examples below)

# MC what's this link
mc_whats_this_main_text=The grading logic of multiple choice questions depends on the option you select.
mcsc_whats_this_text=This is the default option because it's the most common: students get the full point value for selecting a single correct answer and zero points for selecting anything else. This option can be further modified by selecting Enable Partial Credit or Enable Negative Marking.
mcsc_whats_this_text_no_partial_credit=This is the default option because it's the most common: students get the full point value for selecting a single correct answer and zero points for selecting anything else.* 
mcss_whats_this_text=Select this option if multiple answers are correct and you would like to give students full credit for choosing <b>any</b> of them. For instance, question X has options A, B, C, D, where A, B, or D are all correct answers.  If a student selects A, B, or D, he would receive full credit. If he selects C, then he would get zero credit.*
mcms_whats_this_text=Select this option if students need to select <b>all</b> of the correct answers in order to receive full credit.
mcms_whats_this_partial_text=<b>Right Less Wrong:</b>  They will be given partial credit for selecting a correct answer and will be penalized for selecting an incorrect answer. For instance, question X is worth 10 points and has options A, B, C, D, E where A and B are correct choices. Each correct answer has a point value equal to the question point value divided by the number of correct answers. Thus, a student will get 5 points for selecting A or B. They will be penalized 5 points for selecting C, D, or E.
mcms_whats_this_partial_note=<b>Note: </b> Even though a question could have a negative point value based on the grading logic (as in this example), the actual lowest possible total point value for a multiple correct, multiple selection question cannot be less than zero.
mcms_whats_this_full_text:<b>All or nothing:</b>  They will receive full credit only if they choose all of the correct answers and none of the incorrect answers.* \
<br/><br/>* If you want to penalize students for random guessing, then enter a value  in the "Negative point value for incorrect answer selection" field so that students will receive less than zero for an incorrect answer. For instance, if a question is worth 10 points and you enter "5" into the "Negative point value..." field, a correct answer would be worth 10 points and an incorrect answer selection would be worth -5 points.  (For Multiple Correct, Multiple Selection, multiple wrong selections do not result in multiple deductions; students will receive no less than -5.)
enable_partial_credit_text=Select this option if you want to give students partial credit when they choose an answer that is "almost correct." For instance, question X has options A, B, C, D, where A is the correct answer. If students pick A, they would receive full credit, but they could be given some credit for choosing an answer that is almost correct. Enabling this option will allow you to specify a percentage value for each answer.
enable_negative_makrinkg_text=Select this option if you want to discourage random guessing. The value entered into the "Negative point value..." field will be the question's point value if a student makes an incorrect selection. For instance, if a question is worth 10 points and you enter "5" into the "Negative point value..." field, a correct answer selection would be worth 10 points and an incorrect answer selection would be worth -5 points.  
enable_negative_makrinkg_note=<b>NOTE:</b> Even though a question may have a negative point value, the final point value for an assessment will not be less than zero.
reset_to_default_grading_logic_text=Click this link if you change your mind after selecting 'Enable Partial Credit' or 'Enable Negative Marking'. The default grading logic grants full credit for selecting a correct answer and zero credit for selecting an incorrect answer.

emi_pt=Item Points
emi_whats_this=?
emi_whats_answer_point_title=Answer Point
emi_whats_answer_point=Points are given per item. The overall point score for the question is automatically calculated from the sum of the item points.
emi_whats_theme_title=Theme
emi_whats_theme=The theme describes the main topic/domain that the item set will address, and is linked to the learning objectives.  A more generic theme (such as "Diarrhoea") may be used for sampling knowledge over wider fields, and items in that set may include pharmacology, epidemiology and investigations. A more focussed theme (such as "Management of diarrhoea") is used to sample in-depth knowledge, in this case all related to pharmacology.
emi_whats_options_title=Options
emi_whats_options=The options list consists of the potential answer choices to the item, and includes the distracters that are the incorrect or less likely answers for this particular item.

Options that are unnecessarily complicated (combinations of options) or "all/none of the above" are not allowed.
emi_whats_leadin_title=Lead-In
emi_whats_leadin=The lead-in statement specifies the association between the stem and the option list. In the R-type format, the options list (for example, 8 or more potential diagnoses) is summarized in the lead-in statement, for example, "For each of the following patients presenting to the Emergency Room, select the most likely diagnosis." The lead-in should provide clear instructions how the student should respond to the item set.
emi_whats_items_title=Item Stems
emi_whats_items=The stem or item describes the case and what is required from the student. It usually consists of a clinical scenario and a question, for example "A 30yr old man presents with... Select the most likely diagnoses." In the R-type format, the question may be included in the stem or may be situated in the lead-in statement.
