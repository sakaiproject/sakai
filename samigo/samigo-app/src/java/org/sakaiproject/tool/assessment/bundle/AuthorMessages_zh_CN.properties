calc_question_general_instructsion_label=What is a Calculated Question
calc_question_general_instructions1=A calculated question calculates new answers for every test, based on variables whose value changes each time. The answer is based on a formula, using those variables. That is, the variables will be randomly generated from your specified minimum and max range and the formula will be the input the student would be asked for.
calc_question_general_instructions2=A variable definition has a name, a minimum and maximum value, and a number of decimal places. A formula definition has a name, an mathematical expression that uses the variables, and a tolerance, so that answers within that tolerance of the answer are also considered correct.
calc_question_walkthrough_label=Steps to create a Calculated Question
calc_question_walkthrough1=Fill out the Question Text with the information that the student will see, including the variable and formula placeholders (see examples below).
calc_question_walkthrough2=Press the "Extract Variables, Global Variables, Calculations, and Formulas from Question Text" button to create the variables and formulas.
calc_question_walkthrough3=Change the Min, Max, and Decimal Places for all of the variables to define their ranges of valid values.

calc_question_syntax_calculation5=Formula Z would be {s}.
calc_question_syntax_formula1=Create formulas for student input
calc_question_syntax_formula2={{}}
calc_question_syntax_formula3=Use double curly braces {{}} around a letter to create a formula.
calc_question_syntax_global1=Create Global Variables
calc_question_syntax_global2=@@
calc_question_syntax_global3=Global variables are intermediate formulas that can be used within the instructions, other global variables, answer formula, or feedback. Use @@ around the variable names to create a global variable. To display the value of the global variable in the question, rather than the formula, use the double square brackets for internal calculations around the global variable placeholder.
calc_question_syntax_global4=@x1@ or [[@x1@]]
calc_question_definition_label=Definitions
calc_question_definition1=Variables\: These are random numbers generated from the minimum and maximum range specified in the 'variables' section. Variables are uniquely generated for each student and quiz attempt based on this range.
calc_question_definition2=Formulas\: Formulas are pre-defined relationships between the variables.
calc_question_definition3=Creating global variables\: In a global variable you can store a formula and in other sections (instructions, global variables, solution, feedback) you can use this global variable to refer to the calculation.
calc_question_extract_button=Extract Variables, Global Variables, Calculations, and Formulas from Question Text
calc_question_define_calculations=You can also define Calculations in the question text and on correct/incorrect answer feedback. Place double brackets around the Calculation (e.g. [[ 3 + 2 ]]). You may use variables inside Calculations (e.g [[ {a} + {b} ]]). Also, you may use global variables inside Calculations (e.g [[ @x1@ + @y1@ ]]). These calculations can help the student to answer the question. They can also help instructor to check that the question is correctly defined before publishing it
calc_question_answer_variance=You may define acceptable tolerance as a constant (0.01) or percentage (1.5%) of the answer. (Defaults to 0.01).
calc_question_answer_decimal=Variables and formulas support decimals. Default is 3.
calc_question_example1=Kevin has {x} apples. He buys {y} more. Now Kevin has [[{x}+{y}]]. Jane eats {z} apples. Kevin now has {{w}} apples.
calc_question_example1_formula=The formula w in the example above would be defined as\: {x} + {y} - {z}.
calc_question_example1_student=The above question will then be displayed as the following question for the student\: Kevin has 4 apples. He buys 2 more. Now Kevin has 6 apples. Jane eats 2 apples. Kevin now has ___ apples.
calc_question_functions=You can use many math functions including\: sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, abs, exp, sgn, sqrt, log10, and ln.
calc_question_example2=Solve\: cos({a}) * ({c} - {b}) \= {{z}}.
calc_question_example2_formula=The formula z in the example above would be defined as\: cos({a}) * ({c} - {b}).
calc_question_constants=There are built-in constants like pi(3.14...), e(2.718...), or [phi](1.618..). Use them in your formula expression.
calc_question_var_names=Variables, Global Variables and formulas names are alpha-numeric but must begin with an alpha character.
calc_question_unique_names=Variables, Global Variables and formulas cannot have the same name.
calc_question_scientific_notation=You can use scientific notation in variables, global variables, formulas and calculations (e.g 6.02310e23 or 1.67e-27).
calc_question_hideshow=Show/Hide more information on valid characters
calc_question_operators=Valid operators\: + - * / ^ \! \# ()
calc_question_error_syntax=Your answer's acceptable variance and expected decimal places must be formatted in this fashion\: {x+y|1%,2} or {x+y|1,2}. The expected decimal places can be omitted e.g. {x+y|1%}. 6 is the limit on decimal places.
calc_question_error_expression=There is a mathematical error in your answer expression.
calc_question_error_expression_variables=The mathematical formula references a variable that used in the instructions.
calc_question_prompt_preview=After you save, be sure to use Preview Assessment to ensure this questions functions as you expect\!

# MC what's this link
mc_whats_this_main_text=The grading logic of multiple choice questions depends on the option you select.
mcsc_whats_this_text=This is the default option because it's the most common\: students get the full point value for selecting a single correct answer and zero points for selecting anything else. This option can be further modified by selecting Enable Partial Credit or Enable Negative Marking.
mcsc_whats_this_text_no_partial_credit=This is the default option because it's the most common\: students get the full point value for selecting a single correct answer and zero points for selecting anything else.* 
mcss_whats_this_text=Select this option if multiple answers are correct and you would like to give students full credit for choosing <b>any</b> of them. For instance, question X has options A, B, C, D, where A, B, or D are all correct answers.  If a student selects A, B, or D, he would receive full credit. If he selects C, then he would get zero credit.*
mcms_whats_this_text=Select this option if students need to select <b>all</b> of the correct answers in order to receive full credit.
mcms_whats_this_partial_text=<b>Correct minus Incorrect\:</b>  They will be given partial credit for selecting a correct answer and will be penalized for selecting an incorrect answer. For instance, question X is worth 10 points and has options A, B, C, D, E where A and B are correct choices. Each correct answer has a point value equal to the question point value divided by the number of correct answers. Thus, a student will get 5 points for selecting A or B. They will be penalized 5 points for selecting C, D, or E.
mcms_whats_this_partial_note=<b>Note\: </b> Even though a question could have a negative point value based on the grading logic (as in this example), the actual lowest possible total point value for a multiple correct, multiple selection question cannot be less than zero.
mcms_whats_this_full_text=<b>All or nothing\:</b>  They will receive full credit only if they choose all of the correct answers and none of the incorrect answers.* <br/><br/>* If you want to penalize students for random guessing, then enter a value  in the "Negative point value for incorrect answer selection" field so that students will receive less than zero for an incorrect answer. For instance, if a question is worth 10 points and you enter "5" into the "Negative point value..." field, a correct answer would be worth 10 points and an incorrect answer selection would be worth -5 points.  (For Multiple Correct, Multiple Selection, multiple wrong selections do not result in multiple deductions; students will receive no less than -5.)
enable_partial_credit_text=Select this option if you want to give students partial credit when they choose an answer that is "almost correct." For instance, question X has options A, B, C, D, where A is the correct answer. If students pick A, they would receive full credit, but they could be given some credit for choosing an answer that is almost correct. Enabling this option will allow you to specify a percentage value for each answer.
enable_negative_makrinkg_text=Select this option if you want to discourage random guessing. The value entered into the "Negative point value..." field will be the question's point value if a student makes an incorrect selection. For instance, if a question is worth 10 points and you enter "5" into the "Negative point value..." field, a correct answer selection would be worth 10 points and an incorrect answer selection would be worth -5 points.  
enable_negative_makrinkg_note=<b>NOTE\:</b> Even though a question may have a negative point value, the final point value for an assessment will not be less than zero.
reset_to_default_grading_logic_text=Click this link if you change your mind after selecting 'Enable Partial Credit' or 'Enable Negative Marking'. The default grading logic grants full credit for selecting a correct answer and zero credit for selecting an incorrect answer.

emi_whats_answer_point=Points are given per item. The overall point score for the question is automatically calculated from the sum of the item points.
emi_whats_theme_title=Theme
emi_whats_theme=The theme describes the main topic/domain that the item set will address, and is linked to the learning objectives.  A more generic theme (such as "Diarrhoea") may be used for sampling knowledge over wider fields, and items in that set may include pharmacology, epidemiology and investigations. A more focussed theme (such as "Management of diarrhoea") is used to sample in-depth knowledge, in this case all related to pharmacology.
emi_whats_options_title=Options
emi_whats_options=The options list consists of the potential answer choices to the item, and includes the distracters that are the incorrect or less likely answers for this particular item. The options should be homogenous, or "the same kind of thing" such as drugs, organisms, cells or investigations, and should be listed only as words or short phrases. Options that are unnecessarily complicated (combinations of options) or "all/none of the above" are not allowed.
emi_whats_leadin_title=Lead-In
emi_whats_leadin=The lead-in statement specifies the association between the stem and the option list. In the R-type format, the options list (for example, 8 or more potential diagnoses) is summarized in the lead-in statement, for example, "For each of the following patients presenting to the Emergency Room, select the most likely diagnosis." The lead-in should provide clear instructions how the student should respond to the item set.
emi_whats_items_title=Item Stems
emi_whats_items=The stem or item describes the case and what is required from the student. It usually consists of a clinical scenario and a question, for example "A 30yr old man presents with... Select the most likely diagnoses." In the R-type format, the question may be included in the stem or may be situated in the lead-in statement.
