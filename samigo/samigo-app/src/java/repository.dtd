<!--
    The jcdAlias attribute is a shortcut name for the defined connection
    descriptor. OJB use jcdAlias as key for the defined connections.

    The default-connection attribute used to define if this connection
    should used as default connection with OJB. You could define only
    one connection as default connection. It is also possible to set
    the default connection at runtime using
    PersistenceBrokerFactory#setDefaultKey(...) method.
    If set 'true' you could use on PB-api a shortcut-method of the
    PersistenceBrokerFactory to lookup PersistenceBroker instances.

    The platform attribute is used to define the specific RDBMS
    Platform. This attribute corresponds to a
	org.apache.ojb.broker.platforms.PlatformXXXImpl class.

	The jdbc-level attribute is used to specify the Jdbc compliance
	level of the used Jdbc driver.

    The eager-release attribute was adopt to solve a problem occured when
    using OJB within JBoss (>=3.0). Only use within JBoss.

    The batch-mode attribute allow to set batch mode modus global
    from the used connection. It is also possible to change
    batch mode at runtime, using the
    PB.serviceConnectionManager.setBatchMode(...) method.

    The useAutoCommit attribute allow to set how OJB uses
    the autoCommit state of the used connections. The default mode
    was 1. When using mode 0 or 2 with the PB-api, you must use PB
    transaction demarcation.
    0 - OJB ignores the autoCommit setting of the connection and do not
        try to change it. This mode could be helpfully if the
        connection don't let you set the autoCommit state
        (e.g. using datasources from application server).
    1 - set autoCommit explicit 'true' when connection was created
        and temporary set to 'false' when necessary (default mode).
    2 - set autoCommit explicit 'false' when connection was created.

    If the ignoreAutoCommitExceptions attribute is set 'true', all
    exceptions caused by setting autocommit state, will be ignored.
    Default mode 'false'.

	If a jndi-datasource-name for JNDI based lookup of Jdbc
    connections is specified, the four attributes driver, protocol,
    subprotocol, dbalias used for Jdbc DriverManager based construction
    of Jdbc Connections must not be declared.

    The username and password attributes are used as credentials
    for obtaining a jdbc connections.
    If users don't want to keep this information the
    repository.xml file, they could pass user/password
    using PBKey.java to obtain a PersistenceBroker

<!--
	maxActive
	maximum number of connections that can be borrowed from the

	maxIdle
	controls the maximum number of connections that can sit idle in the

	maxWait
	max time block to get connection instance from pool, after that exception is thrown.
	When non-positive, block till last judgement

	whenExhaustedAction
	0 - fail when pool is exhausted
	1 - block when pool is exhausted
	2 - grow when pool is exhausted

	testOnBorrow
	The pool will attempt to validate each object before it is returned from the pool

	testOnReturn
	The pool will attempt to validate each object before it is returned to the pool

	testWhileIdle
	Indicates whether or not idle objects should be validated.
	Objects that fail to validate will be dropped from the pool

	timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis
	indicates how long the eviction thread should sleep before "runs" of examining
	idle objects. When non-positive, no eviction thread will be launched.

	minEvictableIdleTimeMillis
	specifies the minimum amount of time that a connection may sit idle
	in the pool before it is eligable for eviction due to idle time.
	When non-positive, no connection will be dropped from the pool due
	to idle time alone (depends on timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis > 0)

	numTestsPerEvictionRun
	The number of connections to examine during each run of the
	idle object evictor thread (if any)

    validationQuery
    Here you could specify a validation query used by pool to test a
    obtained connection (e.g. "select 1 from dual"), else a default query was
    used - if defined in the platform class for your database.

    logAbandoned
    Only supported when using
    org.apache.ojb.broker.accesslayer.ConnectionFactoryDBCPImpl
    ConnectionFactory implementation.
    Flag to log stack traces for application code which abandoned
    a Statement or Connection. Defaults to false. Logging of
    abandoned Statements and Connections adds overhead for
    every Connection open or new Statement because a
    stack trace has to be generated.

    removeAbandoned/removeAbandonedTimeout
    Only supported when using
    org.apache.ojb.broker.accesslayer.ConnectionFactoryDBCPImpl
    ConnectionFactory implementation.
    Flag to remove abandoned connections if they exceed the
    removeAbandonedTimeout. Set to true or false, default false.
    If set to true a connection is considered abandoned and
    eligible for removal if it has been idle longer than the
    removeAbandonedTimeout. Setting this to true can recover
    db connections from poorly written applications which
    fail to close a connection.

    Sequence Manager implementations

    1. className="org.apache.ojb.broker.util.sequence.SequenceManagerHighLowImpl"
    High/Low sequence manager implementation. This is OJB's default sequence manager.

    2. className=org.apache.ojb.broker.util.sequence.SequenceManagerInMemoryImpl
    InMemory-sequence manager implementation.
    This is the fastest standard sequence manager implementation, but
    has some limitations:
    - do not use in client/server mode
    - do not use in clustered environments
    - do not use if other entities generate id's for the persistent objects

    3. className=org.apache.ojb.broker.util.sequence.SequenceManagerNextValImpl
    Use database based sequence generation. Check your DB for support, add
    a extent aware 'sequence-name' attribute to your autoincrement field
    descriptors. If no sequence-name was found by the implementation,
    an extent aware sequence name is build by it's own.

    4. className=org.apache.ojb.broker.util.sequence.SequenceManagerSeqNextValImpl
    A database sequence based High/Low implementation. See 3. for more informantion.

	The primarykey specifies if the column is a primary key column.

	The nullable attribute specifies if the column may contain null values.

	The indexed attribute specifies if there is an index on this column

	The autoincrement attribute specifies if the values for the persistent

    The sequence-name attribute can be used to state explicitly a sequence
    name used by the sequence manager implementations. Check the docs/javadocs
