1. Problem in 2.1 and earlier version: 

A number of listeners in delivery which were originally written for delivering an assessment
during assessment taking were re-used for other functions such as assessment preview and 
assessment grading. Each of these functions though require the listener to retrieve the same
published assessment but require different displays. E.g. When grading an assessment, the 
instructor need to see the correct answer while when previewing an assessment, it is not 
necessary. Hence, a lot of properties were added to control the display which in time became
very confusing.

Because of all these different functions that the listeners must diffentiate, the code has
also become less manageble.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Things involved

a. functions: take assessment, take assessment via url, preview assessment, 
   review assessment, grade assessment

b. listeners involved: BeginDeliveryActionListener.java, DeliveryActionListener.java, 
   SubmitToGradingActionListener, TotalScoreListener, StudentScoreListener and 
   SelectActionListener. The focus of this rewriting is on BeginDeliveryActionListener.java,
   DeliveryActionListener.java which were being used by most of teh functions above.

c. bean involved: DeliveryBean resides the properties that control the display.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Tasks

a. The task of DeliveryActionListener is to attach the answer submitted by a user to the
   published Assessment and setting the content of the next page for display. It also
   determines if answer feedbacks and grader comment should be displayed based on the nature
   of functions and the feedback option setting of the published assessment.

b. In the case of grading an assessment, TotalScoreListener prepares an index page with a
   summary of total score. When an instructor grade a particular person, StudentScoreListener
   prepares the published assessment and DeliveryActionListener is then called to attach the
   answers.

c. In the case of reviewing an assessment, previewing an assessment, taking an assessment and
   taking an assessment via url, the published assessment is prepared by 
   BeginDeliveryActionListener.
 
d. When taking an assessment, the following events would trigger SubmitToGradingActionListener
   which create AssessmentGradingData and ItemGradingData that would persist to the database.
   SubmitToGradingActionListener knows the end stage of the assessment taking and hence it is 
   also used for preparing the submission confirmation page. 
 
   Here are the events and their paths:
    i. Save and Continue, Previous, Next, TOC & Show Feedback: 
       goto SubmitToGradingActionListener then  DeliveryActionListener
   ii. Save And Exit & Submit ForGrade: 
       goto SubmitToGradingActionListener then SelectActionListener
 
f. Previewing an assessment is the simplest task. BeginDeliveryActionListener creates a
   published assessment, persists it to the DB so each object will then have an id. The
   published assessment is then deleted right away. The published assessment is now a
   java object freed of the DB tied and remains in the JVM memory for us to manipulate.
   In the case of previewing an assessment, there is no need to call DeliveryActionListener.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Rewriting

Apart from reorganizing the structure of BeginDeliveryActionListener and 
DeliveryActionListener, I have eliminated the following properties in the DeliveryBean: 
notPublished, accessViaUrl, previewMode, previewAssessment, reviewAssessment, forGrading. 
 
The two properties in DeliveryBean, actionString and actionMode are used to replaced all
the above properties. Note that actionMode can only set by actionString.
 
  deliveryBean.getActionMode ()         deliveryBean.getActionSring() 
    TAKE_ASSESSMENT = 1;                      "takeAssessment"  
    PREVIEW_ASSESSMENT = 2;                   "previewAssessment"
    REVIEW_ASSESSMENT = 3;                    "reviewAssessment" 
    GRADE_ASSESSMENT = 4;                     "gradeAssessment"
    TAKE_ASSESSMENT_VIA_URL = 5;              "takeAssessmentViaUrl"

I am keeping the properties "feedback" and "noFeedback" for now 'cos I don't understand
the feedback logic enough to make modification.
