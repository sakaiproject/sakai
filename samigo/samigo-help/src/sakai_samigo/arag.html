<h2>Assessment settings</h2>
 
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete these procedures, you must be
assigned a role having the necessary permissions.  To determine your
role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>To reach the <code>Settings</code> page for an assessment:</p>

<ol><li>From the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> of the appropriate site, click
<strong><code>Tests
&amp; Quizzes</code></strong>.  <br /><br />
</li><li>On the <code>Assessments</code> page, click <strong><code>--Select
Action--</code></strong> next to the title of the assessment and choose
<strong><code>Settings</code></strong>.  Click the black arrow for a type of setting to see
the options.
</li></ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Altering the settings for one assessment does
not impact the settings of other assessments you created. Altering the
options in the settings for an assessment does not impact any other
options.</p>

<p>The settings available depend on whether or not your assessment is
published; see <a href="#pub">Settings for published assessments</a>
below.  They may also depend on what Assessment Type you are
using. The default Assessment
Type does not include all possible settings.</p>

<p>If you wish to include more settings than you see available for an
unpublished assessment, you will need to create and edit a new
Assessment Type; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardr">Adding, editing, or deleting an Assessment Type</a>.</p>

<h3>Assessment settings</h3>

<p>Following is a list of all possible settings: </p>
<ul><li><strong>Assessment Type Information:</strong> If you chose to base
your assessment on an existing custom template, its title, author(s),
and a brief description will automatically display here.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Assessment Introduction:</strong> Specify the title and
author(s) of an assessment, add an attachment to the assessment, and
add a description of, or introduction to, the assessment. The
assessment's creator is also listed, but you cannot modify this
information.

<br /><br />
</li><li><a name="dates"> </a><strong>Delivery Dates:</strong> Specify when
(date and time) an assessment will be made available, when it will be
due, and when it will be retracted. To set the dates and times, click
the calendar icon next to each field.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Assessment Released To:</strong> Choose to release the
assessment to anonymous users, restrict its availability to only
site members, or restrict its availability to only selected groups.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you release an assessment to anonymous
users, you must distribute its URL to participants; it will
not be accessible from within your site's Tests &amp; Quizzes tool. Note
the URL while publishing the assessment (see <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardc">Publishing an assessment</a>), or if the assessment is already published, go to
the settings page of the version located under "Published Assessments"
(not the copy under "Pending Assessments"), click to expand
the <strong><code>Assessment Released To</code></strong> section, and copy the URL shown
there.</p>
</li><li><strong>High Security:</strong> You can do either or both of the following:

<br /><br />

<ul><li>Create a unique username and password combination (both fields are
required) that all students use to access the test.
</li><li>Specify that only certain IP
addresses can access your assessment.  An asterisk
( * ) can stand for any single subnet to represent a range
of IP addresses, e.g., 171.64.139.* or 171.64.*.* . 
</li></ul><br />
</li><li><strong>Timed Assessment:</strong> You can specify the amount of
time allowed. This option will cause all student attempts at the
assessment to be submitted automatically when the time is up.

<br /><br />

<a name="layout"> </a>
</li><li><strong>Assessment Organization:</strong> Govern the appearance
and behavior of your assessment. The following options are
available:

<br /><br />

<ul><li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Choose from the following:
<br /><br />

<ul><li><strong><code>Linear access:</code></strong> Limits users to progressing
forward through an assessment without access to the table of contents.
</li><li><strong><code>Random access:</code></strong> Allows users to move from question
to question throughout the assessment using either the
<strong><code>Previous</code></strong> and <strong><code>Next</code></strong> buttons, or the table of contents.
</li></ul>
<br />

</li><li><strong>Question Layout:</strong> Choose to display each
question on a separate web page, each part on a separate web page,
or the complete assessment on one web page.




</li><li><strong>Numbering:</strong> Choose continuous numbering throughout
all parts of the assessment, or choose to restart numbering with each
part.
</li></ul>
<br />
</li><li><strong>Mark for Review:</strong> Enabling the <strong><code>Mark for
Review</code></strong> option adds a checkbox labeled <strong><code>Mark for Review</code></strong>
under every question in an assessment.  Students can check the boxes
to mark questions they would like to return to before submitting the
assessment.  This feature is not available when the assessment is
configured for linear access.  


<br /><br />

</li><li><a name="Submissions"> </a><strong>Submissions:</strong> Specify how many
submissions you'll allow, and use the "Late Handling" option to
indicate whether or not you'll accept submissions after the due date
(see <a href="#dates">Delivery Dates</a> above for information on the
Due Date option). If you choose to accept late submissions, such
submissions will be flagged during grading.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Submission Message:</strong> Type a message or specify a
URL to be delivered to the user upon submission.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Feedback:</strong>

<br /><br />

<ul><li><strong>Feedback Authoring:</strong> Choose from the following:

<br /><br />

<ul><li><strong><code>Question-Level Feedback:</code></strong> Allows feedback based on
question regardless of the answer
</li><li><strong><code>Selection-Level Feedback:</code></strong> Allows feedback based on the
answer given (i.e., different answers depending on which selection the
student chose)
</li><li><strong><code>Both:</code></strong> Allows you to use both types of feedback</li></ul>
<br />
</li><li><strong>Feedback Delivery:</strong> Choose from the following:
<br /><br />

<ul><li><strong><code>Immediate Feedback</code></strong> (i.e., while taking the assessment)

</li><li><strong><code>Feedback on submission</code></strong> 
</li><li><strong><code>No Feedback will be displayed to the student</code></strong> (Overrides
other options, and suppresses all feedback and scores)
</li><li><strong><code>Feedback will be displayed to the student at a specific
date</code></strong> (Click the calendar icon to specify the date.)
</li></ul>

 
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You should not use the Immediate Feedback
setting in Tests &amp;
Quizzes when assessing learning, as it may provide
information students can use to correct their answers before
submitting a test.</p>

</li></ul>

<p>When providing feedback, you have the option to show students only
their assessment scores, or the assessment questions plus any of the
following feedback components:</p>

<ul><li><strong><code>Student Response</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>Correct Response</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>Student's Assessment Scores</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>Student's Question and Part Scores</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>Question-Level Feedback</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>Selection-Level Feedback</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>Grader's Comments</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>Statistics and Histograms</code></strong></li></ul>

<p>If you choose to release any of the items listed above, the tool will
also release questions to students.  To prevent students from seeing
the questions but allow them to see their scores, choose <strong><code>Only
Release Student's Assessment Scores (questions not shown)</code></strong>.  You
cannot release other feedback if you select this option; students will 
see only the total score for the assessment.</p>
</li><li><strong>Grading:</strong>

<br /><br />

<ul><li><strong>Students' Identities:</strong> Choose from the following:

<br /><br />

<ul><li><strong><code>Students' identities can be seen by graders</code></strong>
</li><li><strong><code>Anonymous grading only</code></strong></li></ul>
<br />

</li><li><strong>Gradebook Options:</strong> Choose from the following:
<br /><br />

<ul><li><strong><code>None</code></strong>

</li><li><strong><code>Grades sent to Gradebook:</code></strong> Creates a new item in the Gradebook
</li></ul>
<br />
</li><li><strong>Recorded Score If Multiple Submissions per User:</strong>
Choose from the following: <br /><br />

<ul><li><strong><code>Record the highest score</code></strong>
</li><li><strong><code>Record the last score</code></strong>
</li></ul>
</li></ul> 

<br />
</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Change the appearance of your
assessment:

<br /><br />

<ul><li>Click the palette icon next to the "Background Color" field to
open the color picker. From the drop-down list, select the palette
you'd like to use (<strong><code>Web Safe Palette</code></strong>, <strong><code>Windows System
Palette</code></strong>, or <strong><code>Grey Scale Palette</code></strong>), and then click the
color you want to use for your assessment's background color. The
hexadecimal value representing your color will
automatically populate the "Background Color" field.
</li><li>In the "Background Image" field, you can type the URL of an image
file to be used as the background image.  If the image is smaller than 
the screen, it will be tiled in the display.
</li></ul>

<br />
</li><li><strong>Metadata:</strong> Specify keywords, objectives, and
rubrics to facilitate searches for and categorization of your
assessment. You can also collect metadata for questions.
</li></ul>

<p>To save the settings for an assessment, click <strong><code>Save Settings</code></strong>
at the bottom of the page.</p>
 
<p><strong>Note: </strong>An assessment must contain at least one
question in order to be published.</p>

<a name="pub"> </a><h3>Settings for published assessments</h3>


<p>You can modify the settings, parts, and questions of any assessment
listed under "Pending Assessments". When you publish an
assessment, a copy is created and listed under "Published
Assessments". For the published copy, you can make changes to all the
settings except "Assessment Released To".</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> After you've published an assessment, if you
modify the unpublished version under "Pending Assessments", you'll have to
alter the assessment's name before republishing it. When you publish it,
you'll be creating another copy under "Published Assessments", not
replacing the existing published copy.</p>

<p>Also, if you modify the settings of a test while students are taking
it, the changes will not affect testing sessions in progress.
Students must exit the test and re-enter it in order to have the
modified settings take effect.</p>
