<h2>Ordering questions</h2>
 

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete these procedures, you must be
assigned a role having the necessary permissions.  To determine your
role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>On the <code>Assessments</code> page, click the <strong><code>--Select
Action--</code></strong> drop-down menu next to the title of the assessment you
wish to work on, and choose <strong><code>Edit</code></strong>. You'll see a list of
questions for that assessment. For each question, from the "Question"
drop-down list, select the numerical order in which you'd like that
question to appear. For example, if you'd like a question to be the
third question, select <strong><code>3</code></strong>.</p>

<p>When you reorder a question, it will move questions that were
originally above it down the list, and questions that were originally
below it up the list. For example, if you use the drop-down list to
change question 3 to question 1, then question 1 will become the new
question 2, and question 2 will become the new question 3. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot set the order of questions if the
part containing them is configured for random ordering.</p>
