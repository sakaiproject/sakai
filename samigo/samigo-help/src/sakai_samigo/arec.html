<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this
document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>. To view a list of permissions
associated with a given role, see 
					[You do not have sufficient permission to view this
					document.]
				. For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and Roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>On the Assessments page, click the title of the assessment you wish
to work on. You'll see a list of questions for that assessment. For
each question, from the "Question" drop-down list, select the
numerical order in which you'd like that question to appear. For
example, if you'd like a question to be the third question, select
<strong><code>3</code></strong>.</p>

<p>When you reorder a question, it will swap positions with the
question that previously held that spot. For example, if you use the
drop-down list to change question 3 to question 1, then question 1
will become the new question 3.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot set the order of questions if the
part containing them is configured for random ordering.</p>
