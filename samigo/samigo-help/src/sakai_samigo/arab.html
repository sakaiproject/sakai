<a name="intro"> </a><h3>Introduction</h3>


<p>You can modify the settings, parts, and questions of any assessment
listed under "Pending Assessments". When you publish an
assessment, a copy is created and listed under "Published
Assessments". For the published copy, you can make changes to all the
settings except "Assessment Released To".</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> After you've published an assessment, if you
modify the unpublished version under "Pending Assessments", you'll have to
alter the assessment's name before republishing it. When you publish it,
you'll be creating another copy under "Published Assessments", not
replacing the existing published copy.</p>

<p>Also, if you modify the settings of a test while students are taking
it, the changes will not affect testing sessions in progress.
Students must exit the test and re-enter it in order to have the
modified settings take effect.</p>


 
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You should not use the Immediate Feedback
setting in Tests &amp;
Quizzes when assessing learning, as it may provide
information students can use to correct their answers before
submitting a test.</p>

reveal its options. For more information about the settings and their
options, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arag">Assessment settings</a>.

<a name="parts"> </a><h3>Modifying the parts</h3>

<a name="partpend"> </a>

<h4>Of a pending assessment</h4>


<p>To modify the parts (i.e., sections) of any assessment listed under
"Pending Assessments":</p>

<ol><li>To enter the editing screen, from the drop-down menu to the left
of the assessment title, select <strong><code>Edit</code></strong>. 

<br /><br />
</li><li>Every assessment must contain at least one part. Parts are
signified within an assessment by a line containing the part title, a
drop-down list for determining the order of the parts, plus three
options: <strong><code>Copy to Pool</code></strong>, <strong><code>Remove</code></strong>, and
<strong><code>Edit</code></strong>. (If there is only one part, the <strong><code>Remove</code></strong> option
will not appear.) Each new assessment will include an automatically
created part called "Default". You have the following
options:

<br /><br />

<ul><li>To create a part, at the top, click <strong><code>Add Part</code></strong>. 
</li><li>To change the order in which a part appears in your assessment,
change the number in the drop-down list next to the part's title.
</li><li>To remove a part, click <strong><code>Remove</code></strong>. You'll have the option to
remove the part only (and move its questions to another part), or
remove the part and all its questions.
</li><li>To edit a part, click <strong><code>Edit</code></strong> to the right of that part. You
can then do the following: 

<br /><br />

<ul><li>Change the title. If you do not change the default part's title,
its heading will not appear on your assessment. Any questions or
images you place in this part <strong>will</strong> appear; only the
heading will be hidden.
</li><li>Modify the "Information" field.
</li><li>Choose to create questions individually, or have them randomly
drawn from one of your question pools. For the random draw, you must
also specify how many questions to pull from which question pool,
the point value for the questions, and the type of randomization.
</li><li>Change the order of the questions within the part; choose either
<strong><code>As listed on Assessment Questions page</code></strong> or <strong><code>Random within
Part</code></strong>.
</li><li>Modify the "Objective", "Keyword", and "Rubric" metadata fields.
</li></ul>
<br /></li><li>Click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to save your changes.
</li></ul></li></ol>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<a name="partpub"> </a><h4>Of a published assessment</h4>

<p>You can modify certain elements of the parts of an assessment listed
under "Published Assessments"; however, you cannot change the order of
the parts, nor can you add or remove parts, once an assessment is
published. To modify a part in a published assessment:</p>

<ol><li>From the drop-down menu for the assessment you want to modify, select
<strong><code>Edit</code></strong>.  If prompted, click the <strong><code>Edit</code></strong> button to retract and
modify the assessment.

<br /><br />
</li><li>For the part you want to modify, click <strong><code>Edit</code></strong>.  You can then
do the following:

<br /><br />

<ul><li>Change the title</li><li>Modify the "Information" field</li><li>Add or update attachments</li></ul></li></ol>

<h4>Of a pending assessment</h4>


<p>To modify the questions of an assessment under "Pending Assessments":</p>

<ol><li>From the drop-down menu to the left
of the assessment title, select <strong><code>Edit</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Each question is represented by a line containing the question
number, the type of question and its answer point value, and two
links, <strong><code>Remove</code></strong> and <strong><code>Edit</code></strong>. You have the following
options:

<br /><br />

<ul><li>To change the order in which questions appear, use the
<strong><code>Question</code></strong> drop-down list.
</li><li>To delete the question from the assessment, click
<strong><code>Remove</code></strong>. When prompted, click
<strong><code>Remove</code></strong> to confirm the deletion or <strong><code>Cancel</code></strong> to keep the
question.
</li><li>To open the question editing screen, click <strong><code>Edit</code></strong>. Here,
you can change anything about the question. See <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqyr">Creating questions for an assessment</a>. Click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to keep your changes.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If your pending assessment draws questions from a
question pool, edit those questions in the question pool; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arej">Adding, editing, moving, copying, or removing a question pool or subpool</a>.</p></li></ul>
</li><li>To add more questions to the assessment, you have two
options:

<br /><br />

<ul><li>On the editing screen, beneath the assessment title, use the
<strong><code>Add Question:</code></strong> drop-down list to select the type of question
to add.
</li><li>On the editing screen, at the bottom of each question, use
the <strong><code>Insert New Question</code></strong> drop-down list to select the type of
question.
