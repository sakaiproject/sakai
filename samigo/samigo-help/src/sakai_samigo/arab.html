<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this
document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a
basic understanding of roles and permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>You can modify the settings, parts, and questions of any assessment
listed under "Pending Assessments". When you publish an assessment, a
copy is created and listed under "Published Assessments". For the
published copy, you can make changes only to the following settings:</p>

<ul><li>Under "Assessment Introduction": Title, Creator, Author(s), Description/Intro, and Attachments</li><li>Under "Delivery Dates": Available Date, Due Date, and Retract Date</li><li>Under "Assessment Organization": Navigation and Numbering</li><li>Under "Submissions": Number of Submissions Allowed and Late Handling</li><li>Under "Feedback": Feedback Authoring, Feedback Delivery, and Feedback Components Students Can See</li><li>Under "Grading": Students' Identities and Gradebook Options</li></ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> After you've published an assessment, if you
modify its "Pending Assessments" copy, you'll have to alter the
assessment's name before publishing it. When you publish it,
you'll be creating another copy under "Published Assessments", not
replacing the existing published copy.</p>


<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> You should not use the feedback option in
Tests
&amp; Quizzes when assessing learning, as it may provide
information students can use to correct their answers before
submitting a test. 
</p>



<h3>Modifying the settings</h3>

<p>To modify the settings of an assessment, under "Pending Assessments" or
"Published Assessments":
</p><ol><li>Under the assessment title, click <strong><code>Settings</code></strong>.<br /><br />
</li><li>On the Settings page, click the arrow next to each setting to
reveal its options. For more information about the settings and their
options, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arag">Assessment settings</a>.<br /><br />
</li><li>When you're finished, click <strong><code>Save Settings</code></strong> to save your
changes and return to the Assessments page. To keep the original
settings and discard any changes, click <strong><code>Cancel</code></strong>.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can also modify the settings by clicking
<strong><code>Settings</code></strong> in the editing screen.</p></li></ol>

<h3>Modifying the parts</h3>

<p>You can modify the parts (i.e., sections) of any assessment listed
under "Pending Assessments". To do so:</p>

<ol><li>To enter the editing screen, click the assessment's title. At the
top, you will see a bar containing three options, <strong><code>Add Part</code></strong>,
<strong><code>Settings</code></strong>, and <strong><code>Preview Assessment</code></strong>.<br /><br />

<ul><li>To create a part, click <strong><code>Add Part</code></strong>. To edit a part, click <strong><code>Edit</code></strong> to the right of the part that you wish to edit.
</li><li>To modify the settings for the assessment as described above,
click <strong><code>Settings</code></strong>.
</li><li>To see how the assessment will appear to those taking it, click
<strong><code>Preview Assessment</code></strong>.
</li></ul><br />
</li><li>Every assessment must contain at least one part. Parts are
signified within an assessment by a box containing the part title, a
drop-down list for determining the order of the parts, plus three
options, <strong><code>Copy to Pool</code></strong>, <strong><code>Remove</code></strong>, and
<strong><code>Edit</code></strong>. (If there is only one part, the <strong><code>Remove</code></strong> option
will not appear.) Each new assessment will include an automatically
created part called "Part 1 Default". You have the following
options:<br /><br />

<ul><li>To change the order in which a part appears in your assessment,
change the number in the drop-down list in the part's title bar.
</li><li>To remove a part, click <strong><code>Remove</code></strong>. You'll have the option to
remove the part only (and move its questions to another part), or
remove the part and all its questions.
</li><li>To edit the part, click <strong><code>Edit</code></strong>. You can then do the following:

<ul><li>Change the title. If you do not change the default part's name,
its heading will not appear on your assessment. Any questions or
images you place in this part <strong>will</strong> appear; only the
heading will be hidden.
</li><li>Modify the "Information" field.
</li><li>Choose to create questions individually, or have them randomly
drawn from one of your question pools. For the random draw, you must
also specify how many questions to pull from which question pool,
the point value for the questions, and the type of randomization.
</li><li>Change the order of the questions within the part; choose either
<strong><code>As listed on Assessment Questions page</code></strong> or <strong><code>Random within
Part</code></strong>.
</li><li>Modify the "Objective", "Keyword", and "Rubric" metadata fields.
</li></ul>
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to save your changes.
</li></ul></li></ol>

<h3>Modifying the questions</h3>

<p>To modify the questions of an assessment under "Pending Assessments":</p>

<ol><li>To enter the editing screen, click the assessment's title.<br /><br />
</li><li>Each question is represented by a bar containing the question
number, the type of question and its answer point value, and two
links, <strong><code>Remove</code></strong> and <strong><code>Edit</code></strong>. You have the following
options:<br /><br />

<ul><li>To change the order in which questions appear, use the
<strong><code>Question</code></strong> drop-down list.
</li><li>To delete the question from the assessment, click
<strong><code>Remove</code></strong>. Doing so will take you to a confirmation page. If
you're certain you want to remove the question, click
<strong><code>Remove</code></strong>. To keep the question, click <strong><code>Cancel</code></strong>.
</li><li>To open the question editing screen, click <strong><code>Edit</code></strong>. Here,
you can change anything about the question. For more information, see
<a href="content.hlp?docId=aqyr">Creating questions for an assessment</a>. Click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to keep your
changes or <strong><code>Cancel</code></strong> to cancel your changes.<br /><br /></li></ul>
</li><li>To add more questions to the assessment, you have two
options:<br /><br />

<ul><li>On the editing screen, beneath the assessment title bar, use the
<strong><code>Add Question:</code></strong> drop-down list to select the type of question
to add.
