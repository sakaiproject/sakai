<h2>Creating a new assessment</h2>












<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> You should not use the feedback option in
Tests
&amp; Quizzes when assessing learning, as it may provide
information students can use to correct their answers before
submitting a test. 
</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this
document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a
basic understanding of roles and permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> of the relevant course or project site,
click <strong><code>Tests
&amp; Quizzes</code></strong>.  From the Assessments page, you can
create a new assessment from scratch or by using a template. (For more
information about using templates, see the document <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardr">Adding/creating, editing, or deleting an Assessment Type</a>.) You also can import an assessment; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqys">Importing or exporting an assessment</a>.
</p>

<a name="top"> </a>

<p>There are four basic steps to creating a new assessment:</p>

<ul><li><a href="#name">Name your assessment</a></li><li><a href="#settings">Configure the settings</a></li><li><a href="#sections">Create parts</a></li><li><a href="#questions">Create questions</a></li></ul>

<a name="name"> </a><h4>Name your assessment</h4>

<p>In the New Assessment area, under "Create a new assessment", type a
title for your assessment in the "Title" field, and then click
<strong><code>Create</code></strong>. This takes you to the editing screen.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can also click <strong><code>Quick Create</code></strong>, which
allows you to type or cut and paste in appropriately formatted text
for your assessment.</p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="settings"> </a><h4>Configure the settings</h4>

<p>The <strong><code>Settings</code></strong> link, available from the Assessments page or
from the editing screen, allows you to specify various parameters for
the assessment (e.g., delivery dates and security settings). For more
information on the possible settings for an assessment, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arag">Assessment settings</a>.</p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="sections"> </a><h4>Create parts</h4>

<p>When you create a new assessment, a part (i.e., section) called
"Default" is created automatically. If you leave it named "Default",
that title will not appear on your assessment; to change the part's
name, click <strong><code>Edit</code></strong>. You can begin adding questions immediately
to "Default", or you can add your own parts.</p>

<p>To add a part to your assessment:</p>

<ol><li>On the editing screen, click <strong><code>Add Part</code></strong>.<br /><br />
</li><li>On the part editing screen, next to "Title", type a name for this
part.<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Information", you may use the WYSIWYG editor to enter a
brief description or instructions.<br /><br />
</li><li>If you want to add attachments, click <strong><code>Add Attachments</code></strong>.
<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Type", use the radio buttons to indicate whether you'll be
authoring questions one by one, or using a random draw from one of
your question pools. For the latter option, use the drop-down list to
choose the name of the pool from which to draw them, and use the
accompanying text boxes to indicate the number and point value of
questions. Use the radio buttons to indicate the type of
randomization.<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Question ordering", use the radio buttons to either dictate
the order of questions, or allow a random ordering within the
part.<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Metadata", you may use the text boxes to record any
objectives, keywords, or rubrics.

<br /><br />
</li><li>To save your changes, click <strong><code>Save</code></strong>. To cancel them, click
<strong><code>Cancel</code></strong>.

</li></ol>

<p>New parts will be listed in the order you create them. To switch
the order of two parts, before a part's name, change the number in the
drop-down list (i.e., next to "Part"). For example, if you have three
parts, and you want the third part to appear first, use the drop-down
list to change the <strong><code>3</code></strong> to <strong><code>1</code></strong>. The third part will
become the first part, the first part will become the second part, and
the second part will become the third part.</p>

<p>To edit the name and any of the information and settings
associated with a part, next to that part's name, click
<strong><code>Edit</code></strong>.</p>

<p>Your assessment must always contain at least one part, but you can
remove any of the parts you create. You can also remove the "Default"
part, as long as you've already created another part to replace
it.</p>

<p>To remove a part:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first part listed on the editing screen
will not have the <strong><code>Remove</code></strong> option. To remove the first part,
you must switch its order with another part (if you don't have another
part, you'll have to create one), and then click <strong><code>Remove</code></strong>.</p>

<ol><li>Next to the part's name, click <strong><code>Remove</code></strong>.<br /><br />
</li><li>On the subsequent confirmation screen, use the radio buttons to
choose between the following:<br /><br />

<ul><li><strong><code>Remove part and all questions</code></strong> 
</li><li><strong><code>Remove part only and move question(s) to</code></strong> (use the
accompanying drop-down list to choose another part)
</li></ul><br />
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Remove</code></strong>.
</li></ol>


<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="questions"> </a><h4>Create questions</h4>


<p>You can either create a new question to add to the assessment, or
you can add a question from a question pool.  To add your first
question, first create an assessment, then from the drop-down menu
next to "Add Question:", choose the type of question to add. For more
information on question types, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqyr">Creating questions for an assessment</a>. Once you've selected the type of question, the
question editing screen will open.</p>

<p>To add a question from a question pool, click the drop-down menu
next to Add Question and select "Copy from Question Pool."</p>

<p>On the question editing screen, the available options will depend upon
the type of question you are adding. If you'd like to change the type
of question, you can choose another option from the "Change Question
Type" drop-down menu. Options common to most question types include:</p>
 
<ul><li><strong>Answer Point Value:</strong> Specify the point value for
each response in a question, or specify 0 (zero) for a survey or
ungraded question.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The total points you assign will be
  divided among all the blanks in the question. For example, take the
  following question:</p>

<span class="example">  Roses are {red} and violets are {blue}, but not always.</span>

<p>If you assign 10 points to this question, students will get 5 points
each for filling in "red" and "blue".</p>

</li><li><strong>Question Text:</strong> State the actual question to be
asked.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Answer:</strong> Indicate the correct answer or
answers. You have the option to include feedback for specific
responses (item-level feedback).

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Assign to Part:</strong> If you have created your
own parts, you may assign a question to any of those parts;
otherwise, it will be assigned to the default part.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Assign to Question Pool:</strong> Add this question to a
question pool that you've created. For information about question
pools, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arej">Adding, moving, copying, or removing a question pool or subpool</a>.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Feedback (optional):</strong> Provide feedback for a
correct or incorrect response to the question (question-level
feedback).

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Save:</strong> Click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to add the question to
your assessment or to save any changes to the question.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Cancel:</strong> Click <strong><code>Cancel</code></strong> to abort the
question or changes and return to the editing screen.
</li></ul>

<p>After you insert a question into your new assessment, a drop-down
list, <strong><code>Insert New Question</code></strong>, will appear in the assessment
editing screen at the end of each part. Use this button to add a
question directly to a specific part. Near the top, within the
assessment's title bar, clicking <strong><code>Preview Assessment</code></strong> allows
you to preview the assessment as it presently stands. After you've
saved questions within your assessment, you can use the corresponding
<strong><code>Edit</code></strong> and <strong><code>Remove</code></strong> buttons to alter or delete
questions.</p>
