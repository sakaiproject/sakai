<h2>Creating a new assessment</h2>

 



<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete these procedures, you must be
assigned a role having the necessary permissions.  To determine your
role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>To create a new assessment (e.g., a test, quiz, or survey), in the
<a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> of the relevant site, click <strong><code>Tests
&amp; Quizzes</code></strong>.  From the <code>Assessments</code>
page, you can create a new assessment from scratch or from a
template. (For more about using templates, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardr">Adding, editing, or deleting an Assessment Type</a>.) You also can import an assessment; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqys">Importing or exporting assessments</a>.
</p>

<a name="top"> </a>

<p>There are four basic steps to creating a new assessment:</p>

<ul><li><a href="#name">Name your assessment</a></li><li><a href="#settings">Configure the settings</a></li><li><a href="#sections">Create parts</a></li><li><a href="#questions">Create questions</a></li></ul>

<hr />

<a name="name"> </a><h3>Name your assessment</h3>

<p>In the "New Assessments" area:</p>

<ol><li>In the "Create assessment (enter title)" field, enter a title for
your assessment.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Select the method you would like to use to create your questions:

<br /><br />

<ul><li><strong><code>Create using assessment builder</code></strong> (default): Allows
you to create your assessment questions using a graphical user
interface.
</li><li><strong><code>Create using markup text</code></strong>: Allows you to create
your assessment questions by typing appropriately formatted text. (See
<a href="content.hlp?docId=azrq">Formatting questions with markup text</a>.)</li></ul>
<br />
</li><li>If desired, you can select an Assessment Type using the <strong><code>Choose
assessment type (optional)</code></strong> drop-down box. For more on Assessment
Types, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardr">Adding, editing, or deleting an Assessment Type</a>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Create</code></strong>. This will take you to the editing screen.</li></ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you chose <strong><code>Create using markup text</code></strong> above,
you'll go directly to a screen that allows you to type or paste your 
questions; you won't be able to configure the settings or parts during
the creation process.  However, you can change the settings or parts
from the default options afterward.  To do so, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arab">Modifying an existing assessment</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<a name="settings"> </a><h3>Configure the settings</h3>

<p>The <strong><code>Settings</code></strong> link, available from the
<code>Assessments</code> page or from the editing screen, allows you
to specify various parameters for the assessment (e.g., delivery dates
and security settings). Some settings may change the options you see
when you create your questions in the assessment builder (for
instance, you won't see the option to create selection-level feedback
unless you've chosen to use it in the Feedback settings), so it's a
good idea to configure settings before creating questions. For more
information on the possible settings, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arag">Assessment settings</a>.</p>

 
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You should not use the Immediate Feedback
setting in Tests &amp;
Quizzes when assessing learning, as it may provide
information students can use to correct their answers before
submitting a test.</p>


<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<a name="sections"> </a><h3>Create parts</h3>

<p>When you create a new assessment, a part (i.e., section) called
"Default" is created automatically. If you leave it named "Default",
that title will not appear on your assessment; to change the part's
name, click <strong><code>Edit</code></strong>. You can begin adding questions immediately
to "Default", or you can add your own parts.</p>

<p>To add a part to your assessment:</p>

<ol><li>On the editing screen, click <strong><code>Add Part</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>On the part editing screen, next to "Title", type a name for this
part.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Information", you can use the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbr">rich-text editor</a> to
enter a brief description or instructions.

<br /><br />
</li><li>To add attachments, click <strong><code>Add Attachments</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Type", use the radio buttons to indicate whether you'll be
authoring questions one by one, or using a random draw from one of
your question pools. For the latter option, use the drop-down list to
choose the name of the pool from which to draw them, and use the
accompanying text boxes to indicate the number and point value of
questions. Use the radio buttons to indicate the type of
randomization.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Question ordering", use the radio buttons to either dictate
the order of questions, or allow a random ordering within the
part.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Metadata", you may use the text boxes to record any
objectives, keywords, or rubrics.

<br /><br />
</li><li>To save your changes, click <strong><code>Save</code></strong>. To cancel them, click
<strong><code>Cancel</code></strong>.
</li></ol>

<p>New parts will be listed in the order you create them. To switch
the order of two parts, before a part's name, change the number in the
drop-down list next to "Part". For example, if you have three
parts, and you want the third part to appear first, use the drop-down
list to change the <strong><code>3</code></strong> to <strong><code>1</code></strong>. The third part will
become the first part and the first part will become the third.</p>

<p>To edit the name and any of the information and settings
associated with a part, next to that part's name, click
<strong><code>Edit</code></strong>.</p>

<p>Your assessment must contain at least one part, but you can
remove any of the parts you create. You can also remove the "Default"
part, as long as you've already created another part to replace
it.</p>

<p>To remove a part:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first part listed on the editing screen
will not have the <strong><code>Remove</code></strong> option. To remove the first part,
you must switch its order with another part (if you don't have another
part, you'll have to create one), and then click <strong><code>Remove</code></strong>.</p>

<ol><li>Next to the part's name, click <strong><code>Remove</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>On the subsequent confirmation screen, choose between the
following:

<br /><br />

<ul><li><strong><code>Remove part and all questions</code></strong> 
</li><li><strong><code>Remove part only and move question(s) to</code></strong> (use the
accompanying drop-down list to choose another part)
</li></ul><br />
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Remove</code></strong>.
</li></ol>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<a name="questions"> </a><h3>Create questions</h3>

<p>If you chose <strong><code>Create using markup text</code></strong> earlier, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=azrq">Formatting questions with markup text</a>. If you chose <strong><code>Create using 
assessment builder</code></strong>, see below.</p>

<p>You can either create a new question to add to the assessment, or
you can add a question from a question pool.  To add your first
question, first create an assessment, and then from the drop-down menu
next to "Add Question:", choose the type of question to add. For more
on question types, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqyr">Creating questions for an assessment</a>. Once
you've selected the type of question, the question editing screen will
open.</p>

<p>To add a question from a question pool, from the drop-down menu
next to "Add Question", select <strong><code>Copy from Question Pool</code></strong>.</p>

<p>On the question editing screen, the available options will depend upon
the type of question you are adding. To change the type
of question, choose another option from the "Change Question
Type" drop-down menu. Options common to most question types include:</p>
 
<ul><li><strong><code>Answer Point Value:</code></strong> Specify the point value for
each response in a question, or specify 0 (zero) for a survey or
ungraded question.


<p><strong>Note:</strong> The total points you assign will be
  divided among all the blanks in the question. For example, take the
  following question:</p>

<span class="example">  Polonius advises Laertes: "Neither a {borrower} nor a {lender} be".</span>

<p>If you assign 10 points to this question, students will get 5 points
each for filling in "borrower" and "lender".</p>

</li><li><strong><code>Question Text:</code></strong> State the actual question to be
asked.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong><code>Answer:</code></strong> Indicate the correct answer or
answers. You have the option to include feedback for specific
responses (selection-level feedback).

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong><code>Assign to Part:</code></strong> If you have created your
own parts, you may assign a question to any of those parts;
otherwise, it will be assigned to the default part.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong><code>Assign to Question Pool:</code></strong> Add this question to a
question pool that you've created. For information about question
pools, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arej">Adding, editing, moving, copying, or removing a question pool or subpool</a>.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong><code>Feedback (optional):</code></strong> Provide feedback for a
correct or incorrect response to the question (question-level
feedback).

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong><code>Save:</code></strong> Click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to add the question to
your assessment or to save any changes to the question.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong><code>Cancel:</code></strong> Click <strong><code>Cancel</code></strong> to abort the
question or changes and return to the editing screen.
</li></ul>

<p>After you insert a question into your new assessment, a drop-down
list, <strong><code>Insert New Question</code></strong>, will appear in the assessment
editing screen at the end of each part. Use this option to add a
question directly to a specific part. Near the top, clicking
<strong><code>Preview</code></strong> allows you to preview the assessment as it presently
stands. After you've saved questions within your assessment, you can
use the corresponding <strong><code>Edit</code></strong> and <strong><code>Remove</code></strong> buttons to
alter or delete questions.</p>
