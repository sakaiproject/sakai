<h2>Viewing or exporting participant scores and
answers to individual questions</h2>

 

<p>To view student scores and answers to individual questions in
Tests &amp;
Quizzes:</p>

<ol><li>In the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> of the relevant site, click <strong><code>Tests &amp;
Quizzes</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>On the <code>Assessments</code> page, under "Published
Assessments", find the pertinent assessment. Next to its title, click
<strong><code> --Select Action-- </code></strong>, and then click
<strong><code>Scores</code></strong>. By default, the <code>Total Scores</code> screen will
open, displaying a table with the following information for each
participant:

<br /><br />

<ul><li>Name
</li><li>User ID 
</li><li>Role
</li><li>Submit Date (the date the participant submitted the assessment)
</li><li>Score

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Unsubmitted assessments will show a single dash
( - ) in the "Adjustment" column.  The tool will not
automatically send a score of zero to the gradebook when a student
does not take an assessment. To enter a score for an unsubmitted
assessment, type a value in the "Adjustment" column, and then click
<strong><code>Update</code></strong> to save your changes.</p>
</li><li>Adjustment (a field for you to enter an adjustment that will be added to
the Score; click <strong><code>Update</code></strong> to save your changes)
</li><li>Final Score (the participant's final score, calculated by adding the 
Score and Adjustment values)
</li><li>Comment for Student (a text box in which you can type comments that will
appear when participants view their submitted tests; click
<strong><code>Update</code></strong> to save your changes)

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In addition to providing feedback in the
comment text boxes, you can attach files on the <code>Questions</code>
page or on a student's individual submission page.</p>
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> By default, the information on the <code>Total
Scores</code> screen is sorted alphabetically by participant name. To
sort the information using another column, click the name of the
column. If you created sections
using the Section Info tool, you can use the drop-down list near the
top of the screen to choose to view information for a particular
section only. If you allowed multiple submissions, you can
use the drop-down list near the top of the screen to view only the
submission with the highest score.</p>
</li><li>To see the questions on the test, and your participants' answers
to each, near the top of the screen, click
<strong><code>Questions</code></strong>. Navigate through questions by clicking the
question links near the top of the screen. This can allow you to
quickly compare how all students answered a specific question.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For Short Answer/Essay questions, you can view the
entire response on the question page (rather than just the first few words
with a link) by changing the drop-down option from <strong><code>Responses Pop-Up</code></strong>
to <strong><code>Responses Inline</code></strong>.
</p>
</li><li>To see the total number of submissions, the
total score possible, and statistical information (such as the mean,
median, mode, and range of the scores), near the top of the screen,
click <strong><code>Statistics</code></strong>.

<p>Beneath the cumulative information, each question is listed with a
histogram showing the number of students who selected a particular
response. </p>
</li><li>To see information about student performance on each item, click
<strong><code>Item Analysis</code></strong>.  Here you can see:

<br /><br />

<ul><li>A column labeled "N", showing the number of students who were 
presented with this question.

<br /><br />
</li><li>The percentage who got the question correct among the whole group,
the upper 27% of test takers, and the lower 27%.

<br /><br />
</li><li>An index labeled "Discrim", which measures how well an item is
able to distinguish between students who perform well and those who
perform poorly on the test as a whole.  A score of 1 represents
perfect discrimination (i.e., all the top students got it correct and
all the lowest students missed it), a score of 0 represents an equal
number of top performers and low performers who answered correctly,
and a negative score means that more low performers than top
performers answered correctly.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For any question with more than one response,
the discrimination index measures the difference between students who
got the entire question correct and those who did not.</p>
</li><li>The number of students who skipped the question.

<br /><br />
</li></ul>


</li><li>To export all assessment responses in Excel format, click <strong><code>Export</code></strong>. 
<br /><br /></li><li>To see only the ungraded questions on the test, and your
participants' answers to each, near the top of the screen, click
<strong><code>Ungraded</code></strong>.
