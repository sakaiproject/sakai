<h3>About Assessment Types</h3>

<p>An Assessment Type is a pre-selected set of assessment settings that
can make it simpler for you to create assessments. You can use any
Assessment Type you create in all of your sites.</p>

<p>When you create or edit an Assessment Type, you determine what changes
to settings you can make when you use the Assessment Type to create
assessments. For more, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardm">Creating a new assessment</a> and
<a href="content.hlp?docId=arag">Assessment settings</a>.</p>

<p>When you create or edit an Assessment Type, you determine what
changes to settings you can make when you create assessments based on
the Assessment Type. The following settings and options are available:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Assessment Type Information:</strong> In the fields
provided, set the title, author, and description for your Assessment
Type. To make this information appear in the settings for any
assessments that use this Assessment Type, check <strong><code>Can be
viewed?</code></strong>

<br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>Assessment Introduction:</strong> Check these boxes to
make it possible to edit the "Author" and "Description" fields.

<br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>Assessment released to:</strong> Use these radio buttons to determine who can take an assessment that's based
on this Assessment Type.

<br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>High Security:</strong> Check these boxes to make it
possible to set optional security restrictions on assessments. If you
leave these boxes unchecked, the "High Security" settings will be
unavailable in assessments created with this Assessment Type.

<br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>Timed Assessment:</strong> If you check this box, you'll
have the option to make the assessment timed and to auto-submit
answers if time runs out. If you leave this box unchecked, the "Timed
Assessment" setting will be unavailable in assessments created with
this Assessment Type.

<br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>Assessment Organization:</strong> These settings control
the flow of the assessment as students take it. Use the radio buttons
to choose the default values for these settings; use the checkboxes to
allow changes. If you leave the checkboxes empty, the default values
will always take effect in assessments created with this Assessment
Type.

<br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>Mark for Review:</strong> Enabling the Mark for Review
option adds a checkbox labeled <strong><code>Mark for Review</code></strong> under every
question in an assessment.  Students can check the boxes to mark
questions they would like to return to before submitting the
assessment.  This feature is not available when the assessment is
configured for linear access.  In the settings for your Assessment
Type, use the first checkbox to determine whether or not you can
change this setting; use the second checkbox to select the default
value for this setting.

<br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>Submissions:</strong> These
settings control how many times students can take the assessment, and
whether or not they can take the assessment after the due date. Use
the radio buttons to choose the default values for these settings; use
the checkboxes to allow changes. If you leave the checkboxes empty,
the default values will always take effect in assessments created with
this Assessment Type.

<br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>Submission Message:</strong> The Submission Message and
Final Page URL appear on the last page of the assessment,
after the student has clicked <strong><code>Submit for Grading</code></strong>. Check these boxes
to allow the insertion of custom messages and URLs here. If
you leave the checkboxes empty, these options will be unavailable in
assessments created with this Assessment Type.<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Under "Feedback Authoring", you can
choose <strong><code>Question-Level Feedback</code></strong>, <strong><code>Selection-Level
Feedback</code></strong>, or <strong><code>Both</code></strong>. Under "Feedback Delivery", you can
choose if and when students will see feedback. Under "Feedback
Components Students Can See", you can choose what kinds of feedback
they'll see. You can also choose whether or not you'll be able to
change these settings.

 
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You should not use the Immediate Feedback
setting in Tests &amp;
Quizzes when assessing learning, as it may provide
information students can use to correct their answers before
submitting a test.</p>

</li><li><strong>Grading:</strong> The grading options control the
following:

<br />
<br />

<ul><li>Whether or not graders can see student names
</li><li>Whether or not assessment scores are sent to the Gradebook tool
</li><li>How scores for multiple submissions are handled
</li></ul>

<p>Use the radio buttons to choose the default value for these settings;
use the checkboxes to determine whether or not you can change them. If
you leave the checkboxes empty, the default values will always take
effect in assessments created with this Assessment Type.</p>
</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Check this box to allow changes to
the assessment's background color or background image. If you leave
this box unchecked, the "Graphics" options will be unavailable in
assessments created with this Assessment Type.

<br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>Metadata:</strong> The "Metadata" settings are text fields
for recording useful information about an assessment or a
question. The three metadata fields available are
"Objective", "Keyword", and "Rubric". If you leave these boxes
unchecked, metadata can't be recorded in assessments created with this
Assessment Type.
