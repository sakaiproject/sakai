<h2>Modifications to
published assessments</h2>













<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete these procedures, you must be
assigned a role having the necessary permissions.  To determine your
role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>You can modify the settings, parts, and questions of any assessment
listed under "Pending Assessments". When you publish an
assessment, a copy is created and listed under "Published
Assessments". For the published copy, you can make changes to all the
settings except "Assessment Released To".</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> After you've published an assessment, if you
modify the unpublished version under "Pending Assessments", you'll have to
alter the assessment's name before republishing it. When you publish it,
you'll be creating another copy under "Published Assessments", not
replacing the existing published copy.</p>

<p>Also, if you modify the settings of a test while students are taking
it, the changes will not affect testing sessions in progress.
Students must exit the test and re-enter it in order to have the
modified settings take effect.</p>


<p>To remove a published assessment, from the Assessments screen,
click <strong><code>Remove</code></strong> below the published assessment you wish to
remove. When you are prompted to confirm the removal, click
<strong><code>Remove</code></strong> again.</p>
