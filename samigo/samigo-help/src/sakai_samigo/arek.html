<h2>Giving an assessment</h2>
 

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete these procedures, you must be
assigned a role having the necessary permissions.  To determine your
role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>


<p>In order to give an assessment, you must first publish it. For
instructions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardc">Publishing an assessment</a>. Once it's
published, your assessment's availability depends on how you've
configured certain settings:</p>

<ul><li>The assessment will be available only during the time frame you
specified in the "Delivery Dates" setting. If you leave the "Delivery
Dates" fields blank, your assessment will be available indefinitely, or
until you retract it. For more, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arba">Retracting or removing an assessment</a>. 

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Assessment released to:" setting, if you selected
<strong><code>Anonymous Users</code></strong>, the assessment will be available only via
the URL (not from within the site), and anyone to whom you've given
the URL can take it. If you selected your site or
<strong><code>Selected Groups</code></strong>, then only site members or members of the
groups you checked will be able to take the assessment (either via the
URL or from within the site). See <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbn">Taking an assessment</a>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>If you created a secondary username and password in the "High
Security" setting, people will need to authenticate with
that username and password to gain access.
</li></ul>
