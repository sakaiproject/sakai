<h2>Taking an assessment</h2>


 

<p>To take an assessment, click its name in the list of available
assessments in Tests &amp;
Quizzes, or use the URL supplied by your
instructor, if applicable.</p>



<p>To start an assessment from within Tests &amp; Quizzes:</p>

<ol><li>From the site's <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>, click <strong><code>Tests &amp;
Quizzes</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Take an assessment", you'll see a list of available
assessments. Click an assessment's title to get started.  You'll see
information about the assessment, such as the date due, whether or not
there is a time limit, and whether or not the assessment will
automatically be submitted if the time limit expires.  Your instructor
may have also included special instructions.

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Be sure you understand how much time you have
to submit the test.</p>
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Begin Assessment</code></strong> to take the assessment, or
<strong><code>Cancel</code></strong> to abort.

<br /><br />
</li><li>How you proceed through the questions will depend on how the 
instructor has set up the assessment.  If the assessment has more than
one page, click <strong><code>Next</code></strong> to save the current page and advance to the
next one.  If you have the option to do so, click <strong><code>Previous</code></strong> or
use the Table of Contents to return to earlier questions.

<br /><br />
</li><li>When you're ready to submit the assessment, click <strong><code>Submit for Grading</code></strong> on
the last page of the assessment or on the <code>Table of
Contents</code> page, and then click <strong><code>Submit for Grading</code></strong>
again to confirm your submission.  You'll receive a confirmation
number, which you should keep.
</li></ol>

<h4>Tips and tricks</h4>

<ul><li><strong>Back button:</strong> Never click your browser's <strong><code>Back</code></strong>
button while taking an assessment.  Doing so may throw you out of the
assessment and/or generate an error message.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Backspace:</strong> Don't use the <code>Backspace</code>
key unless your cursor is in a field where you can enter text.
Pressing <code>Backspace</code> under other circumstances may throw
you out of the assessment and/or generate an error message (like the
browser <strong><code>Back</code></strong> button).

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>If you lose access:</strong> If you lose access to an assessment
for any reason, and there is still time left to complete it, return to the
tool and re-enter the assessment.  You should be able to pick up where you
left off.

<br /><br />

  </li><li><strong>Saving your answers:</strong> If an assessment page
      contains multiple questions or an essay question that takes time
      to answer, click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> periodically to protect yourself from
      losing data if the due date passes or you lose access to the
      assessment.

<p>Some people prefer to draft answers to essay questions in a word processor
and then paste them into the answer field.  If you do so, be sure to
click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> immediately after pasting your response.</p>

</li><li><strong>Formatting: </strong>
In short answer/essay questions, you may have the option of formatting
your text with the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbr">rich-text editor</a>; to do so, click <strong><code>Show/Hide
Rich-Text Editor</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Reviewing your work:</strong> If your instructor has
enabled the Mark for Review feature, you can check a box under each
question that you would like to review later.  To go back to questions
you marked, before submitting the test, click <strong><code>Table of
Contents</code></strong>.  Questions you have marked for review will appear with
a question mark.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must select an answer before checking the
<strong><code>Mark for Review</code></strong> box.</p>
