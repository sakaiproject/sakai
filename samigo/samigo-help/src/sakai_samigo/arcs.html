<h2>Restricting access to published
assessments</h2>








<p>You cannot modify the access settings of a published assessment,
but you can remove a published assessment, modify the access settings
in the Core assessment, and publish it again. To remove a published
assessment, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcx">Deleting an assessment</a>. To change the
access settings, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arag">Assessment settings</a>.</p>

<p>You can modify the settings, parts, and questions of any assessment
listed under "Core Assessments". When you publish an assessment, a
copy is created and listed under "Published Assessments". For the
published copy, you can make changes only to the "Delivery Dates" and
"Feedback Delivery" settings.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> After you've published an assessment, if you
modify its "Core Assessments" copy, you'll have to alter the
assessment's name before publishing it. When you publish it,
you'll be creating another copy under "Published Assessments", not
replacing the existing published copy.</p>
