<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this
document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a
basic understanding of roles and permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>Creating questions is only one of the steps involved in creating an
assessment. Consider also reading the following documents:
</p><ul><li><a href="content.hlp?docId=ardm">Creating a new assessment</a></li><li><a href="content.hlp?docId=arag">Assessment settings</a>
</li></ul>

<p>You can choose from several types of questions when building an
assessment; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=argy">Types of questions available for assessments</a>.</p>




<p>In the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> of the relevant course or project site,
click <strong><code>Tests
&amp; Quizzes</code></strong>. To create a new assessment, under the
"New Assessment" heading, type a name for your assessment in the
"Title" field. </p>

<p>You can use the drop-down menu next to <strong><code>Choose
Existing Assessment type</code></strong> to choose a template for your
assessment. You can also import an assessment by using the
<strong><code>Import</code></strong> feature. For more information, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqys">Importing or exporting an assessment</a>. </p>

<p>When you have made your choices, you have two options to create the
assessment:</p>


<ul><li>The <strong><code>Quick Create</code></strong> option allows you to type in your
questions or cut and paste them from a text file. You will have to
follow the formatting instructions found on the bottom of the page.

<br /><br />
</li><li>The <strong><code>Create</code></strong> option takes you to the question editor. To
begin adding questions to a new assessment, choose the type of
question you want to add from the <strong><code>Add Question:</code></strong> drop-down
menu. Below are instructions for each question type: <br /><br />

<ul><li><a href="#multa">Multiple Choice</a></li><li><a href="#surveya">Survey</a></li><li><a href="#essaya">Short Answer/Essay</a></li><li><a href="#fiba">Fill in the Blank</a></li><li><a href="#numerica">Numeric Response</a></li><li><a href="#mata">Matching</a></li><li><a href="#truea">True/False</a></li><li><a href="#audioa">Audio Recording</a></li><li><a href="#filea">File Upload</a></li><li><a href="#uploada">Copy from Question Pool</a></li></ul></li></ul>

<a name="multa"> </a><h4>Multiple Choice</h4>

<p>To create a Multiple Choice question:</p>
<ol><li>In the Questions screen, from the <strong><code>Add Question:</code></strong> drop-down
menu, select <strong><code>Multiple Choice</code></strong>. This takes you to the editing
screen.
<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Answer Point Value" field, enter the point value you want
to assign to this question. Enter <code>0</code> (zero) if you wish
this to be an ungraded question.
<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Question Text" field, enter the text for the
question. Click <strong><code>Show/Hide Rich-Text Editor</code></strong> to display the
WYSIWYG toolbar.<br /><br />
</li><li>If you wish to add an attachment, click <strong><code>Add Attachments</code></strong>
and enter or browse to a filename or enter a URL.
<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Answer" section, click the radio buttons to choose
between <strong><code>Single correct answer</code></strong> (the default) and <strong><code>Multiple
Correct Answers</code></strong>. As you change the selection, the screen will
refresh to allow or hide the requisite fields.  <br /><br />
</li><li>In the case of a single correct answer, you'll see four sets of
text boxes for possible answers and optional feedback. To indicate
which answer is the correct one, click the radio button next to it. In
the case of multiple correct answers, check the boxes beside the
correct responses.

<p>If you want to present fewer possible answers, click
<strong><code>Remove</code></strong> beneath the text boxes you want to remove. If you want
to present more possibilities, use the drop-down menu next to
<strong><code>Insert additional answers</code></strong> to select the number of
possibilities you want to add.</p>
</li><li>If you want the possible answers to appear in a random order,
under "Randomize Answers", click <strong><code>Yes</code></strong>. To have them appear in
the order you see in the question editing screen (the default), click
<strong><code>No</code></strong>.<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Require Rationale", choose <strong><code>Yes</code></strong> or <strong><code>No</code></strong> (the
default) depending on whether you want to require users to provide a
rationale for choosing an answer.
<br /><br />

</li><li>From the <strong><code>Assign to Part</code></strong> drop-down menu, choose the part
(i.e., section) to which you want to assign this question. Leave this
as the default value if you haven't created any parts.<br /><br />
</li><li>If you want to assign this question to a question pool, from the
<strong><code>Assign to question pool</code></strong> drop-down menu, select the desired
pool name.<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Correct/Incorrect answer feedback", you can provide
question-level feedback for correct and/or incorrect answers. 
<br /><br />
</li><li>When you're finished, click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to return to the
assessment editing screen. You'll see that your new question has been
added to the assessment.
</li></ol>

<a name="surveya"> </a><h4>Survey</h4>

<p>The process for creating a Survey question is
similar to that used to create a Multiple Choice question, except for
the following differences:</p>
<ul><li>The "Answer Point Value" field default is <code>0</code>
(zero). <br /><br />
</li><li>For the text of possible answers, you must choose from a
predefined set of scales commonly used for survey reporting. To select
the scale you want to use, click its corresponding radio button. The
choices are:<br /><br />

<ul><li><strong><code>Yes, No</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>Disagree, Agree</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>Disagree, Undecided, Agree</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>Below Average -&gt; Above Average</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>Strongly Disagree -&gt; Strongly Agree</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>Unacceptable -&gt; Excellent</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>1 -&gt; 5</code></strong></li><li><strong><code>1 -&gt; 10</code></strong></li></ul><br />
</li><li>You do not have the option to randomize answers or require a
rationale.
</li></ul>
<a href="#topa">Back to top</a>
<a name="essaya"> </a><h4>Short Answer/Essay</h4>

<p>
To create a Short Answer/Essay question:
</p>

<ol><li>In the Questions screen, from the <strong><code>Add Question:</code></strong>
drop-down menu, select <strong><code>Short Answer/Essay</code></strong>.<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Answer Point Value" field, enter the point value you want
to assign to this question. Enter <code>0</code> (zero) if you wish
this to be an ungraded question.<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Question Text" field, enter the text for the
question. Click <strong><code>Show/Hide Rich-Text Editor</code></strong> to display the
WYSIWYG toolbar.

<br /><br />
</li><li>If you wish to add an attachment, click <strong><code>Add Attachments</code></strong>
and enter or browse to a filename or enter a URL.
<br /><br />
</li><li>From the <strong><code>Assign to Part</code></strong> drop-down menu, choose the part
(i.e., section) to which you want to assign this question. Leave this
as the default value if you haven't created any parts.<br /><br />
</li><li>If you want to assign this question to a question pool, from the
<strong><code>Assign to question pool</code></strong> drop-down menu, select the desired
pool name.<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Answer:" section, you can opt to provide a model short
answer or question-level feedback by typing it in the provided
fields.<br /><br />
</li><li>When you're finished, click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to return to the
assessment editing screen. You'll see that your new question has been
added to the assessment.
</li></ol>

<a href="#topa">Back to top</a>
<a name="fiba"> </a><h4>Fill in the Blank</h4>

<p>To create a Fill in the Blank question:</p>
<ol><li>In the Questions screen, from the <strong><code>Add Question</code></strong>
drop-down menu, select <strong><code>Fill in the Blank</code></strong>.<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Answer Point Value" field, enter the point value you want
to assign to this question. Enter <code>0</code> (zero) if you wish
this to be an ungraded question.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The total points you assign will be
  divided among all the blanks in the question. For example, take the
  following question:</p>

<span class="example">  Roses are {red} and violets are {blue}, but not always.</span>

<p>If you assign 10 points to this question, students will get 5 points
each for filling in "red" and "blue".</p>


</li><li>In the "Question Text" field, enter the text for the
question. Click <strong><code>Show/Hide Rich-Text Editor</code></strong> to display the
WYSIWYG toolbar. Place curly braces
(<code> { } </code>) around words requiring a blank,
for example:

<span class="example">  In Unix, to find the current directory path, type {pwd} at the prompt.</span>

<p>Other options for building a Fill in the Blank question include:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Wildcards:</strong> Use an asterisk
(<code> * </code>) to represent one or more characters in a
response. For example:

<span class="example">An adverb, like {*ly}, modifies a verb.</span>
</li><li><strong>Either|Or:</strong> If two or more specific answers could
belong in a blank, you can use a pipe (<code> | </code>) to
separate them. For example:

<span class="example">  {red|yellow|blue} is the primary color I like best.</span>
</li><li><strong>Case sensitivity:</strong> Check <strong><code>Case sensitive</code></strong>
if case matters in the response. For example:

<span class="example">  The capital of California is {Sacramento}.</span>
</li><li><strong>Mutual exclusivity:</strong> Check <strong><code>Mutually
exclusive</code></strong> if your question has two or more blanks with identical
answer choices, but the student must answer each one differently. For
example:

<span class="example">  When you toss a coin, it lands on {heads|tails} or {heads|tails}.</span>

<p>If the answers are mutually exclusive, the student must type
"heads" in one blank and "tails" in the other to answer the question
correctly. If the answers were not mutually exclusive, then typing
"heads" in both blanks would be considered correct.</p>

<p>You can use the mutually exclusive option only when it applies to
all the blanks in a question. For example, take the following
question:</p>

<span class="example">  We mixed {red|blue} and {red|blue} dye together to make {purple}.</span>

<p>If you select the mutually exclusive option for the above question,
it will automatically uncheck itself when you save your question.</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>If you wish to add an attachment, click <strong><code>Add Attachments</code></strong>
and enter or browse to a filename or enter a URL.
<br /><br />
</li><li>If your assessment has more than one part (i.e., section), use the
<strong><code>Assign to Part</code></strong> drop-down menu to assign the question to a specific
part.<br /><br />
</li><li>To save the question in a question pool for later use, from the
<strong><code>Assign to question pool</code></strong> drop-down menu, select the desired
pool name. To do this, you must have created at least one question
pool. For instructions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arej">Adding, moving, copying, or removing a question pool or subpool</a>.<br /><br />
</li><li>The "Correct/Incorrect answer feedback" fields allow you to set
optional messages for students. Use the assessment's feedback settings
to determine if and when students see these messages. For more
information, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arag">Assessment settings</a>.<br /><br />
</li><li>When you're finished, click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to return to the
Questions screen. You'll see that your new question has been
added to the assessment.

menu, select <strong><code>Numeric Response</code></strong>.<br /><br />

</li><li>In the "Question Text" field, enter the text for the question.
Click <strong><code>Show/Hide Rich-Text Editor</code></strong> to display the WYSIWYG
toolbar. Place curly braces (<code> { } </code>)
around characters requiring a blank, for example:

<span class="example">  4*4={16}</span>

<p>Insert a pipe (<code> | </code>) between range limit values,
for example:</p>

<span class="example">  The tree's age is {121|145} years.</span>

<p>Every value between 121 and 145 will be a valid response.</p>
