<h2>Retracting or removing an assessment</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete these procedures, you must be
assigned a role having the necessary permissions.  To determine your
role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>You can remove (i.e., delete) both pending assessments and published assessments.
You can also retract a published assessment from student access, and
then make it available to students again later.</p>

<h3>Retracting a published assessment</h3>

<ol><li>Under "Published Assessments", from the drop-down menu for the
assessment you want to retract, select <strong><code>Settings</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>On the <code>Settings</code> page, click <strong><code>Delivery Dates</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>You can either retract your assessment immediately or specify a
date and time.

<br /><br />

<ul><li>To retract the assessment immediately, click <strong><code>Retract
Now</code></strong>. Then, click <strong><code>Retract</code></strong>, or click <strong><code>Cancel</code></strong> to
return to the <code>Settings</code> page.

<br /><br />
</li><li>To retract the assessment at a specified date and time, click the
calendar icon to the right of the "Retract Date" text box.  Select a
date and time, and then, at the bottom of the screen, click <strong><code>Save
Settings</code></strong>.
</li></ul>
</li></ol>



<p>When you retract an assessment, it remains under "Published
Assessments", but moves from the "Active (testing in progress)"
section to the "Inactive (no student access)" section.</p>

<p>To return a retracted assessment to active status (i.e., to re-open it
for submissions), follow the above steps, but delete the date and time
from the "Retract Date" text box. The assessment will have the same
URL as it did before you retracted it.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Students cannot take or submit an assessment
that has been retracted.</p>

<h3>Removing an assessment</h3>

<ol><li>Under "Published Assessments" or "Pending Assessments", from the drop-down menu
for the assessment in question, select <strong><code>Remove</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Remove</code></strong> again to confirm.
 </li></ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Removing a published assessment deletes all student
submissions and the corresponding gradebook item.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can only export the  pending copy of the assessment for use in future
semesters, not the published copy.  Do not delete the  pending copy unless you know you won't need it in
the future.</p>
