<h2>Sharing question pools</h2>







<p>By default, only you will be able to access the question pools you create, but you can share your question pools with other instructors from within the application.  </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can only share a question pool with a user who has  permission to create assessments, and you must share the question pool from a site for which both you and the user have such a role; it does not have to be the site where you created the pool.  Once someone shares a question pool with you, you can then access the pool from any site in which you have the ability
to create assessments, unless the creator of the pool revokes access.</p>

<p>To share your question pool with another user:</p>


<ol><li>In the menubar, click <strong><code>Tests &amp; Quizzes</code></strong>; then, at the top of the page, click <strong><code>Question Pools</code></strong>.
<br /><br />
</li><li>Under the name of your desired question pool, click <strong><code>Share</code></strong>.
<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Grant access", check the box(es) that correspond to the instructors with whom you would like to share the question pool, and then click <strong><code>Share</code></strong>.
</li></ol>

<p>To revoke a user's access to a question pool you've shared:</p>

<ol><li>In the menubar, click <strong><code>Tests &amp; Quizzes</code></strong>; then, at the top of the page, click <strong><code>Question Pools</code></strong>.
<br /><br />
</li><li>Under the name of your desired question pool, click <strong><code>Share</code></strong>.
<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Revoke access", check the box(es) that correspond to the instructors with whom you no longer want to share the question pool. Then, click <strong><code>Share</code></strong>.
</li></ol>
