# This holds all the choices for the various options in the application.
#
# conventions:
#
# In every case of a boolean, the false answer goes first (0=false) and the
# true answer goes second (1=true) and they follow the convention xxx.false and xxx.true.
#
# In multiple options they follow the zero base convention: xxx.0, xxx.1, xxx.2... etc.
# also they follow the dot convention of properies files so that a camel case JavaBean
# property such as xxxYyyZzz# becomes a properties file message xxx.yyy.zzz.#  ...
#
# in some cases (checkboxes) multiple options may be presented with related names
# closely following the properties in the datamodel without numbering
