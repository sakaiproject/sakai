<h2>Adding Resources to the Page</h2>

<a name="top"> </a>

<p>NOTE: resources and multimedia are similar. Both can be either files or URLs. The 
difference is that resources appear as links in your Lessons page, whereas
multimedia is displayed in a box on the page, if the student's browser is able to do this.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Add Resource</strong> at the top of the page.</p> 
<p>You can add a file to your page by:</p> 
<ul>
  <li>Clicking <strong>Browse...</strong> or <strong>Choose file</strong>  and locating the file on your computer. Click <strong>Save</strong> to complete the process. The file will be added to your page and stored in the Resources tool in a folder with the same title as your Lessons tool.</li>

  <li>Supplying the web address of a file or web page in the <em>URL</em> text box. Click <strong>Save</strong> to complete the process.</li> 

  <li>Clicking <strong>Choose Existing File</strong> to select a file that has already been uploaded to Resources. Select the file that you want to add to your page by clicking <strong>Select</strong>. Complete the process by clicking <strong>Continue</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h5><a name="3.1">Edit a Resource</a></h5>
<p>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button to the left of the resource you would like to modify.</p>

<p>This will open up an <em>Edit Item</em> box on your screen. The options available for modification are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Item Name</strong> - Change the name of the text on the link to your resource on the main Lessons page.</li>
  <li><strong>Item Description</strong> - Change/add a description to your resource, which will appear beneath the link to the resource.</li>
  <li><strong>Change File or URL</strong> - Change the file being linked to, or the URL if you're using a Web Link.</li>
  <li><strong>Open item in a new window</strong> - causes Lessons to open the item in a new window. This can sometimes be useful or items that that browser will open rather than download, e.g. web pages.
  <li><strong>Don't Release Item Until All Prerequisites are Completed</strong> - Select this option if you would like it to appear/be accessible only after previously 'Required' items have been completed/accessed.
</li>
  <li><strong>Require This Item </strong>- Select this option to make this item a 'Required' item for later on in the Lessons plan.</li>
  <li><strong>Edit the groups for which this item should be shown </strong> - If you have groups or sections in the site, allows you to make this
item visible only to some groups. Students who are not in one of the checked sections of groups will not see this item on their page at all.</li>

</ul>

<p>To save your changes, click <strong>Update Item</strong>.</p>
<h5><a name="3.2">Delete a Resource</a></h5>

<p>Click <strong>Edit</strong> to the left of the resource you would like to remove, then click <strong>Delete</strong>.</p>
<p>The delete function in Lessons only removes the link on the Lessons page.
If you would like to completely delete an uploaded file from your worksite, the file will also need to be removed from the Resources tool. To do this, click <strong>Resources</strong> on the left menu and click on the folder that has the same title as the Lessons from which the file was removed. Click <strong>Actions --> Remove</strong> to the right of the file. Click <strong>Remove</strong> to complete the process.</p>

<h5><a name="3.2">Access Controls for Resource</a></h5>

<p> When you select <b>Don't Release Item Until All Prerequisites are Completed</b>, Lessons will
control students' access to the resource. The resources are actually stored in the Resources tool.
That means that students can get to them directly, through that tool. If you don't want to allow
that, you can set the resource or the folder containing it to Hidden in the resources tool. Lessons
can access files even if they are hidden.</p>

<p> If the resource is an HTML page, there can be issues with images and other items
referred to on the page. You can make them public. But you can also put the images, etc, somewhere else in the same folder
as the main document, and set either the individual files or the folder to hidden, in the
Resources tool. When you access a file in Lessons, if the file is accessible, it will
also allow you to access other files in the same folder, even if they are hidden.
