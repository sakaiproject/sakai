<h2>Settings </h2>

<a name="top"> </a>

<p> The settings dialog allows you to adjust various parameters
of the current page:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Don't Release Page Until All Prerequisite Pages are Completed </strong> - Select this option if you would like the page to appear/be accessible only after previously 'Required' pages have been completed/accessed. You can use this on both subpages and top-level pages (pages that appear in the
left margin). If you use it on a subpage, the student won't be able to click on the page until all prerequisites have been completed. If you use it
on a top-level page, the student will be ablet to click on the page in the left margin, but will get a message listing the pages that have
to be completed first.</li>
<li><strong>Require this page </strong> - This page must be completed before the student can access later pages.</li>

<li><strong>Create gradebook entry when page is completed.</strong> - This will create a gradebook item for this
page. Students will be given a specified number of points when they complete the page. Completing the page means
doing all required items on it. If there aren't any required items, simply viewing the page will mark it as complete.

<li> <strong>Custom CSS File</strong> - This permits you to supply a style sheet to be used with the page. This can
be used to change fonts, add backgrounds, and make other style adjustments. Because preparing style sheets can
be difficult, your system administrator may choose to prepare style sheets for you. If they have done so, the
menu will show a list of system-wide style sheets. You may also upload your own. They will be available for
any page in the site. If you name the file default.css, it will be the default for your site, i.e. it will be used for any
page that doesn't specify a style sheet. Your system administrator may supply a system-wide default. It will be used
for any page that doesn't specify a style sheet if you don't have you own default.</li>

</ul>

<p> The following options only appear on top-level pages, i.e. pages that show in the left margin:
<li><strong>Hide this page from users.</strong> - Use this when you're not ready for students to see
the page yet. It will not appear in the left margin.</li>

<li> <strong>Hide this page until the following date</strong> - Use this when you want a page to become
available at a certain date or time. Note that the page will show in the left margin before then, but
won't be usable. (There is no way to specify release dates for items in the left margin.)</li>

</ul>

<h3> More information about style sheets </h3>

<p> If you are writing a style sheet, you may find it useful to know some classes that 
you may use, and the sections of the page that they control:

<ul>
<li>You can of course use body to change things like fonts and sizes for
everything. However they may also affect buttons and other functional
objects, so you may prefer to use classes for more specific things.
Here are the major class you might want to change in your stylesheet:

item-icon: This is for the icons that show on resources. The only thing
useful I can think of is setting display:none is you don't want icons in
your site. You may, of course, use <strong>body</strong> for any changes
that should apply to the whole page.

<ul>
<li>breadcrumbs: the section with links to the page above, used in subpages and other items</li>
<li>title: the main page title</li>
<li>mainlist: the table containing the primary content. (Do not rely on this being a table. It
could become a list in a later version.)</li>
<li>itemlink: the &lt;a&gt; for resources, etc.</li>
<li>itemtext: the text inside the &lt;a&gt;</li>
<li>itemdescription: the description field added by the author</li>
<li>textbox: the text inside a text block inserted by "add text"</li>
<li>commentsDiv: the whole section with student comments</li>
<li>commentDiv: a single student comment</li>
<li>author: the author's name in a student comment</li>
<li>specialCommenter: the author's name if the current user is the author</li>
<li>commentBody: the text of a student comment</li>
<li>studentDiv: the whole section for student pages</li>
<li>studentTitle: the heading "Student Pages"</li>
<li>studentLink: the &lt;a&gt; for an individal student page
</ul>
