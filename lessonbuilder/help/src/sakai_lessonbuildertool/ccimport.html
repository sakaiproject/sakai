<h2>Import Common Cartridge</h2>

<a name="top"> </a>

<p> This function allows you to read a file in IMS Common Cartridge
Format. This format is used by content vendors to supply instructional
material, including tests and pages of content. Other course management
systems such as Blackboard can also export the contents of a course
in Common Cartridge format. So this can be used to move content
between course management systems.

<p>Use the "More Tools" pull-down and choose <strong>Import CC</strong>.</p> 

<p> Currently Sakai can read Common Cartridge versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2.

<p> When you import a Common Cartridge, it can (depending upon the cartridge)
create new pages with content on them, and add tests, forum topics, and assignments.
It can also create question pools. If it create a question pool, you will only see the pool
if you go into Tests and Quizes and use "Questions Pools."

<h5>Roles</h5>

<p> Cartridges can specify that certain resources should be available
only to instructors, or only instructors and "mentors." Lessons
does not implement mentors, as there is no natural Sakai equivalent.
Instructor-only content is intended for things such as answer sheets.

<p> For the current release of Lessons, instructor-only content
is loaded into the site, but not placed on a page. Where the tool 
permits it, it is hidden. Currently this is implemented as follows:
<ul>
<li> Resources are set to be "hidden."
<li> Assessments in Tests and Quizes (Samigo) are not published. Note
that assessments in Mneme are never published by the import process,
so this distincton is not necessary for Mneme.
<li> Topics in Forums are marked as "Draft". 
</ul>

<p> No method is currently implemented to hide topics in YAFT or Jforums.
