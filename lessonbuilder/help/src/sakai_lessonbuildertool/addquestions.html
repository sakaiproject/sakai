<h2>Adding Simple Questions to a Page</h2>

<a name="top"> </a>

<p>This function lets you add multiple choice and short answer questions to a Lessons page. These questions can be graded, or used as polls.</p>

<p>Use the "Add Content" pull-down and choose <strong>Add Question</strong>.</p> 

<p>To add a <strong>multiple choice</strong> question:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Select <strong>Multiple Choice</strong> as the question type.</li>
  <li>Input the text of your question under <strong>Question Text</strong>.</li>
  <li>Insert the possible answer choices under the <strong>Possible Answers</strong> heading.  Press <strong>Add New Answer</strong> to add an additional answer choice, and check the checkbox next to the answer text to mark it as a correct answer. (For polls, do not mark any answer as correct.)</li>
  <li>Optionally allow students to see a bar graph of how other students have answered after they themselves have answered by selecting the checkbox <strong>Show students a graph of how others responded after they answer the question</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>To add a <strong>short answer</strong> question:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Select <strong>Short Answer</strong> as the question type.</li>
  <li>Input the text of your question under <strong>Question Text</strong>.</li>
  <li>Insert the possible answer choices under the <strong>Possible Answers</strong> heading.  Press <strong>Add New Answer</strong> to add an additional answer choice.  Note that answer choices are <em>not</em> case sensitive.</li>
</ul>

<p>For both question types:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To insert an entry in the Gradebook for this question, select <strong>Grade this question</strong>. If you select this, you 
must supply a title for the assignment in the Gradebook, and the maximum number of points.</li>
  <li>Any text in the textbox <strong>Text shown if answer is correct</strong> is only shown to students that answer a question correctly.  Similarly, text in <strong>Text shown if answer is incorrect</strong> is only shown to students that answer the question incorrectly.</li>
  <li><strong>Don't Release Item Until All Prerequisites are Completed</strong> - Select this option if you would like it to be accessible only after previously required items have been completed.</li>
  <li><strong>Require that the student submit this assignment </strong>- Select this option to make this item a required item; students must complete required items before progressing in a Lessons plan. Any answer will count. They do not need to submit a correct answer.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Grading</h5>

<p> To specify a correct answer, check one of the answers (multiple choice), or supply at least one answer (short answer). If you do not
specific a correct answer, your question is either ungraded or manuallyy graded.

<p> There are 3 different types of grading:

<ul>
<li> Ungraded, i.e. polls. No correct answer is supplied, and <strong>Grade this question</strong> is not checked.
<li> Automatic grading. A correct answer is supplied. If you specify <strong>Grade this question</strong> and a number of points, you can override Lessons' automatic grading by entering the number of points yourself in the Grading Pane. An answer is considered correct if you give it the maximum number of points.
<li> Manual grading. No correct answer is supplied, but <strong>Grade this question</strong> is checked. In this case, you must use the Grading Panel to grade the question. An answer is considered correct if you give it the maximum number of points.
</ul>

<p>
If <strong>Grade this question</strong> is checked, you must specify the name of an iten in the Gradebook.</p>

<h5>View a Graph of the Responses to a Multiple Choice question</h5>

<p>Click the <strong>Show Poll</strong> button above the multiple choice question you would like to see the responses to.  A simple bar graph will appear below the question, displaying the number of students that selected each answer choice.  Click <strong>Hide Poll</strong> to hide the graph.</p>
