<h2>Export Common Cartridge</h2>

<a name="top"> </a>

<p> This function allows you to save (download) a file in IMS Common Cartridge
Format containing the contents of the current site.
Other course management
systems such as Blackboard can load the contents of a course
in Common Cartridge format. So this can be used to move content
between course management systems. It can also be used if you simply want
to save the contents of your site in a form that can be used later.</p>

<p> Note that the Common Cartidge format only handles some aspects of
a site. Details will be lost. E.g. only the most common types of quiz
question will be saved. And items that Lessons would put inline on the page
(e.g. blocks of text added with "Add Text" and movies added with "Add Multimedia")
will appear as links when the Common Cartridge file is loaded.<p>

<p> The export will contain a file in the resources area called
cc-objects/export-errors. It will contain a list of any problems in
exporting, including questions and Lessons content that can't be
handled by the Common Cartridge format.</p>

<p> Here are the types of content that will be included:</p>
<ul>
<li> Lessons pages</li>
<li> Quizes in Samigo. (Mneme is currently not exported.)</li>
<li> Assignments in Assignments or Assignments 2.</li>
<li> Forum topics in Forums and jForum</li>
</ul>

<p> Note that most other systems do not recognize assignments. They
simply import the text of the assignmentn as a document.</p>

<p> Currently Sakai can save in Common Cartridge versions 1.1 and 1.2.
1.2 is the default. We've seen problems trying to load 1.2 files into
Moodle and Blackboard, so we recommend using version 1.1 for them.
The only significant difference is that 1.2 is supposed to understand
Assignments, and also quiz questions of type "Multiple Correct, Single Answer."
However no implementation we've found other than Sakai actually treats
these types correctly.</p>
