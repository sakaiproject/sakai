<h2>Adding Embedded Content to the Page</h2>

<a name="top"> </a>

<p>NOTE: "Add Content Link" and "Embed Content on Page" are similar. Both can add files or URLs. The 
difference is that content links appear as links in your Lessons page, whereas
embedded content is displayed on the page. Normally Embed Content is used for audio and video where you want
a player to appear on your page. However it can be used for other types of file (e.g. Adobe PDF) as well.
Whether embedded content will actually work depends upon whether browsers can display it, or can
find a player to display it.</p>
  
  <h4><a name="6">Embed Content on Page</a></h4>
<p>This option allows you to show media files or links (such as videos and songs), and present them directly on the page. 
Embed Content can also double as a Web Content tool, allowing you to link to and display websites in your Lessons page.</p>

<p>Use the "Add Content" pull-down and choose <strong>Embed Content on Page</strong>.</p> 

<p> There are several different ways to use this tool:

<ul>
<li> <strong>Upload a file.</strong> In this case Lessons will choose a player to show
the file. The player depends upon the type of file and the browser.
In order to get the best results on a variety of devices, 
we recommend using MP4 format. For best use on portable devices, the
file should be prepared with software that specifically optimizes for
those devices. For audio, we recommend MP3, although WAV is also widely
supported.</li>

<li> <strong>Select an existing resource</strong>. Use this if you have
already uploaded the file, and it is available in the site's Resources tool.</li>

<li> <strong>Enter a URL for a file stored on the web.</strong> This should produce
the same result as uploading the file through Lessons.</li>

<li> <strong>Enter a URL for a video sharing site, e.g. Youtube.</strong> Lessons can
recognize URLs for most common video sites, and add appropriate players.
Most video sharing sites have options in the player to give you the 
URL for the video. Simply using the URL that shows in the bar at
the top of your browser may not work.</li>

<li> <strong>Enter an "embed code" or "widget code" for a video sharing site.</strong>
Most video sharing sites have options in the player to give you an
appropriate embed code. Many sites will give you both a URL and an
embed code. You might try both to see which works better. Other things
being equal, we recommend using the URL.</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p> In many cases, you will need to adjust the size of the box in which the content is shown.
Use the Edit button, as explained below.

<h5><a name="6.1"> Edit Multimedia</a></h5> 

<p>To edit your multimedia content, first click <strong>Edit</strong> to the left of the item you would like to modify.</p> 

<p>This will open up an <em>Edit Item</em> box on your screen. The options available for modification are as follows:</p>	
<ul>
  <li><strong>Height</strong> - Change the height of the internal frame that will display your web link or contain your media. Note, you may use either percentages (%) or pixels (px) to denote either relative or absolute measurements.</li>
  <li><strong>Width</strong> - Change the width of the internal frame that will display your web link or contain your media. Note, you may use either percentages (%) or pixels (px) to denote either relative or absolute measurements.</li>
  <li><strong>Item Description</strong> - Change/add a description to your multimedia file, which will appear beneath the multimedia file.</li>
  <li><strong>Change File or URL</strong> - Change the source of the media or change the URL of your web link.</li>
  <li><strong>Edit the groups for which this item should be shown </strong> - If you have groups or sections in the site, allows you to make this
item visible only to some groups. Students who are not in one of the checked sections of groups will not see this item on their page at all.</li>

</ul> 
<p> For images, we recommend setting either width or height and leaving
the other blank. The browser will pick an appropriate size for the one
you left blank.</p>

<p>Some players will stretch or cut off the image if you don't set the right size. Older copies of Windows Media Player (e.g. on Windows XP) seem particularly prone to this. So for movies, it is safest to adjust the size to match the actual size and shape of the movie.</p>

<p>To save your changes, click <strong>Update Item</strong>. To remove the multimedia item from your Lessons page, click <strong>Delete</strong>.</p>

<h5><a name="3.2">Delete a Resource</a></h5>

<p>Click <strong>Edit</strong> to the left of the resource you would like to remove, then click <strong>Delete</strong>.</p>
<p>The delete function in Lessons only removes the link on the Lessons page.
If you would like to completely delete an uploaded file from your worksite, the file will also need to be removed from the Resources tool. To do this, click <strong>Resources</strong> on the left menu and click on the folder that has the same title as the Lessons from which the file was removed. Click <strong>Actions --> Remove</strong> to the right of the file. Click <strong>Remove</strong> to complete the process.</p>
