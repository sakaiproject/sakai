Lesson Builder is a way to structure content. Use cases include

* Online courses, which often want to structure material by unit or
  week. It must be easy to link to quizes and assignments, and to
  handle common types of content.

* Online training, which needs to define sequences of material.

* Online certification, which needs to require certain items to be
  done, and sometimes to limit access until prerequistes are met.

I'll still be doing work, but this version should be usable.

Our thanks go to Joshua Ryan, whose Simple Page Tool is the basis for
this code. (You may note that some files and classes are still named
SimplePage. We have changed the package name and enough other things
that this shouldn't conflict with the original tool.)

It has only been tested on mysql, though I would expect it to work
with the other databases.

BUILDING

To build, the normal Sakai maven commands will work. However you'll
probably need to edit pom.xml to change versions. The main pom.xml
file in this directory is all you should have to change. pom files
in other directories take their information from this one.

You'll need to change two things;

1) Near the top, in the <parent> declaration, the version
should match your version of Sakai. Currently it is
2.9-SNAPHOT. For 2.8 you'd use 2.8.0, 2.8.1, etc.

2) Look for the <profile> declaration. There are two
profiles. The default is set for 2.9 and later. If you're
building for 2.7 or 2.8, move the <activation> lines

            <activation>
                <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
            </activation>

from the profile saying <id>default</id> down to the second profile,
with <id>sakai-2.8</id> So it would read

            <id>sakai-2.8</id>
            <activation>
                <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
            </activation>

You can also use this sakai-2.8 profile with 2.7.

Then for the profile you're using (either default or 2.8), set the
appropriate version numbers for the components we use. You can look at
pom.xml in your "master" directory to see the version numbers for
entitybroker, assignment, msgcntr, and samigo. Normally assignment,
msgcntr and samigo will match the version of Sakai, although that
may not always be true. entitybroker has separate version numbering.

Other than that, the properties can be left as is. In particular,
don't change the version of RSF. We depend upon a newer version than
the rest of Sakai.

DATABASE SETUP

If you run with auto.ddl set, Lesson Builder will create the
necessary tables. Otherwise BEFORE YOU DEPLOY IT, please
take the appropriate sql file, e.g.

./hbm/src/ddl/mysql/lessonbuilder.sql

Indices are created separately, so once the tables exist
you will want to create the indices using

./components/src/ddl/mysql/simplepage.sql

You may get an error because there is one index created by
the first sql script.

DATABASE UPDATES WITH AUTODDL

When moving from an old version to a new one, the easiest approach
is to have auto.ddl on. In that case, the update should happen
automatically. Unfortunately a few changes can't happen automatically.
So you may find files in ./components/src/ddl/mysql for specific
changes, e.g.

./components/src/ddl/mysql/simplepage.pre29-to29.sql

Comments at the start of the files will give more detalis. We
hope that they will be harmless if used when they are not needed,
but the comments will note that.


DATABASE UPDATES WITHOUT AUTODDL

When moving from an old version to a new one, you need to do two
separate things: (1) things that Hibernate would do if auto.ddl
were on and (2) other changes.

Starting with the 2.9 release of Sakai, we will include update scripts
that do what Hibernate would do, e.g.

hbm/src/ddl/mysql/lessonbuilder-2.9.0-2.10.0.sql

These scripts are not perfect. They will only work if you are going 
between two versions of Lessons that shipped with a Sakai release.

In other situations, you can make your own update script. There is a
script, schemaupdate, that reads lessonbuilder.sql for the old version
and the new version, and produces a file that will update your schema
from one to the other.

You'll want to go to hbm/src/ddl and do "mvn clean install sakai:deploy"
That will read the hibernate files and produce the following file
that has all the declarations that Hibernate would use:

hbm/src/ddl/mysql/lessonbuilder.sql 

Then go to your new surce, do the same thing, and put the copy from
the old source here:

hbm/src/ddl/old/mysql/lessonbuilder.sql 

Then run

hbm/src/ddl/old/schemaupdate

This will produce an update script for you in

hbm/src/ddl/mysql/

So to update without auto.ddl, 

1. generate and load the update script (or if you're going between two
versions shipped with Sakai starting with 2.9, use the update scrip I
supply).

2. Use the follwoing to upgrade indices.

./components/src/ddl/mysql/simplepage.sql

3. Look for  any other scripts in ./components/src/ddl/mysql that
apply to your change, e.g.

./components/src/ddl/mysql/simplepage.pre29-to29.sql

However we're going to try and avoid special scripts like that
in the future if possible.


TOMCAT

We strongly recommend using "-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8" in JAVAOPTS for Tomcat. 
Without this you may get strange failures when importing Common Cartridge
files. Lesson Builder is not the only application that requires this. 
Problems have been reported in Samigo as well.

This option goes on the command line in start-sakai.sh or start-sakai.bat
in the demo. Normally for production setups JAVAOPTS is set in tomcat/bin/catalina.sh
or tomcat/bin/setenv.sh.

BLTI

A note on the two sakai.blti properties, sakai.blti.version and
sakai.blti.scope. Lesson Builder supports BLTI. However it requires
the version from Sakai 2.9, which is BLTI version 2. If you are using
2.8 (and haven't added the 2.9 version of BLTI), you will want to
leave the sakai.blti properties in pom.xml as they are set for the 2.8
profile. In order to compile and start, you must have the BLTI API
file. By using a scope of "compile" the 2.9 version of that API file
will be fetched from a repository and included in the WAR file. Since
you won't have the actual implementations, when Lesson Builder looks
up the implementations at startup, it will get a null, and will
disable BLTI. But the API file has to be there, or it won't start
properly.

The 2.9 profile defines the scope as "provided", because you want
to use the actual API file from your system. With 2.9, you'll
also want the version number to match the version of BLTI you are
using, which will probably be shown in master/pom.xml.


INSTALLATION

The most recent version of Lesson Builder is set up so that it should
be usable without any setup after simply installing the code. However
some work will be needed to get full functionality. How much work that
is depends upon the version of Sakai.


FOR A MORE PERMANENT SETUP:

1) As an admin, using the Realm tool. Check your template realms to
make sure that the right permissions are set. This is !site.template,
!site.template.course, and templates for any other site type that will
use Lesson Builder. The templates apply only to new sites. However for
existing sites, if Lesson Builder is started by someone with the
maintain or Instructor role, they will be given the opportunity to fix
up permissions for their site.
  
  * for maintain-type roles, typically maintain and Instructor,
set lessonbuilder.upd and lessonbuilder.read.
  * for other roles, set just lessonbuilder.read

That's enough to try Lesson Builder. For real you, there are
a few more things:

2) Integrating Lesson Builder with other tools may require
some changes, depending upon the version of Sakai you are
running:

* You will probably want to install SAK-20799. This allows people to
hide tools without disablign them. A lot of faculty want to hide the
assignments and tests tool so students can only go through Lesson
Builder. The problem with hiding a tool in page order is that it
disables the tool. This patch give you two options, one that disables
the tool but one that just hides it.

* 2.8.1 and 2.9 -- OK otherwise

* 2.8 - may need both Samigo changes and a fix to Forums, and
also fixes to the Sakai kernel. See below for Samigo and
kernel fixes.

* before 2.8 - like 2.8, except Forums is probably OK

The rest of this document talks about other things you might want to
know about. However you can try out Lesson Builder without doing
anything beyond this point.

THE PDA PORTAL

If you want to use iPhones, etc, Sakai gives you a separate UI. This
UI turns out to cause problems for certain internal operations. In
order go get web resources to open properly, and grading screens to
work properly on an Iphone, you'll want to add the following line to
your sakai.properties.

portal.pda.bypass.sakai.lessonbuildertool=linktracker$|/uvbview$|\.jpg$|\.gif$|\.js$|\.png$|\.jepg$|\.css$|\.zip$|\.pdf\.mov$|\.json$|\.jsonp$\.xml$|\.ajax$|\.xls|\.xlsx|\.doc|\.docx

The first two alternatives, i.e. linktracker$|/uvbview$, are the critical ones. The rest
are the defaults. It's not clear whether they're actually used.

If you are using a Sakai version older than 2.8.0 (even a beta of 2.8)
you will need a minor change to the portal to make this
property functional. You should be able to do the following

patch ../portal/portal-impl/impl/src/java/org/sakaiproject/portal/charon/handlers/PDAHandler.java <PDAHandler.java.diff

That is, the file PDFHandler.java.diff in this directory contains the
patch, which should be applied to the file 
portal/portal-impl/impl/src/java/org/sakaiproject/portal/charon/handlers/PDAHandler.java
in your source tree.

MNEME, YAFT, ASSIGNMENT2,  BASIC LTI AND JFORUM DEPENDENCIES

LessonBuilder will support quizes from Mneme, topics from JForum or
YAFT, assignments from Assignment 2 and external tools using Basic
LTI. If your system doesn't use them, you can ignore this section.

Mneme, Assignment 2, and YAFT are commented out in the build, to
comply with Sakai rules about contrib tools. To enable them, look in
tool/pom.xml. It should be obvious what needs to be uncommented. That
should be the only change necessary.

The Mneme, Jforum, Assignment 2, YAFT and BLTI code starts by checking
whether those modules are actually present. If not, it disables
itself. Thus there's no obvious reason to remove any of it, although
you can do so.

Note however that the jForum and YAFT interfaces are not currently
able to create topics when importing Common Cartridge documents, nor
do they support releasing a topic to a specific group. In Common
Cartridge import, It will leave a place holder in the page. You will
need to create the topic and choose it in Lesson Builder. The problem
is that jForum does not have an API that allows another tool to create
items, and YAFT isn't group-aware.

Note that the version number of Mneme, YAFT, Assignment 2, and BLTI
are defined in the main pom.xml, in the declarations for
sakai.mneme.version, sakai.yaft.version and sakai.blti.version. If you
are using using Mneme, YAFT or BLTI in your site, then you will need
to change the version numbers in the file to match the version number
you are using locally. Otherwise there could be problems with Lesson
Builder using the wrong version of the interface code. Of course the
Mneme and YAFT version numbers are irrelevant unless you uncomment the
code that uses them.

Note that basiclti.version is set to a version for Sakai 2.9, even
with the 2.8 build profile. Lesson Builder's LTI support will not work
with the Sakai 2.8 version, and in fact Lesson Builder won't even
build. So you'll need to leave the BLTI version number at 2.0 or
higher, even if you are actually using a lower version of BLTI on your
system. If you are using an older BLTI, then the BLTI will be built
with the 2.9 version, but at runtime BLTI support will be disabled.


SAKAI VERSIONS

This code has been used at Rutgers in 2.7.0, 2.7.1, and 2.8. It should
work in 2.5 or 2.6, though some changes in the pom.xml files may be
needed. To pick your version, you will need to change the version
number in the <parent> declaration for pom.xml here. This is, in

  <parent>
    <artifactId>master</artifactId>
    <groupId>org.sakaiproject</groupId>
    <relativePath>../master/pom.xml</relativePath>
    <version>2.9-SNAPSHOT</version>
<!--   <version>M2</version>--><!-- 2.5.x -->
  </parent>

Instead of 2.9-SNAPSHOT, use your version of Sakai.

You may also need to change the profile. Lesson Builder is
distributed for use with Sakai 2.9. To use it with 2.7 or
2.8, look for the <profiles> section in pom.xml. There are
two profiles, named "default" and "sakai-2.8". Move the
declaration 
         <activation>
                <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
         </activation>
from default to sakai-2.8. The 2.8 profile should also
work for 2.7.

If you are using Mneme, check the version number for org.etudes.mneme
in tool/pom.xml. Make sure the version number matches the version of
Mneme that you are using. Similarly if you are using YAFT, check
the yaft version number.

SAMIGO FIXES

You can skip this section when you're first trying out Lesson Builder,
or if you are using Sakai 2.8.1 or later.

There are two things you'll want to do to Samigo:
* fix some of its HTML so that it doesn't "escape" its frame
* add a JSP to allow Lesson Builder to edit quizes and settings

SAMIGO FIXES, Part 1. FIX SAMIGO SO IT WON'T ESCAPE ITS FRAME

As distributed, Samigo (Tests and Quizes) has a problem: when you get
to the end of a test, the "Continue" button will take you back to the
main page of Samigo. We run Samigo in an Iframe, and supply a link to
return to the Lesson. However Samigo's "Continue" completely replaces
the top-level web page, thus escaping from the Iframe. This will leave
most students confused.

There's another problem: for many error situations, Samigo will send
you to the main Sakai login page. Most users will think this means that
Sakai has lost track of their session, and will login again. In fact
their session is just fine, but logging in will give them a new session
and lose anything that's in progress.

These problems have been reported to the Samigo team.

OPTION 1:

The file "sam.diff" has patches that will fix both of these problems.
Unfortunately it only works if you are willing to build Samigo from
source. I strongly recommend that you do this. 

OPTION 2:

If you can't build Samigo from source, there's a script that should
fix the Samigo binary. Wait until the Samigo WAR file has deployed,
and then go to .../tomcat/webapps/samigo-app/jsf/ and run the file
fix-samigo. Note that this script has only been tested in OS X, but
it should also work for Unix and Linux.

If the script doesn't work for you, you can go to
.../tomcat/webapps/samigo-app/jsf/delivery, look for all .jsp files
containing _top, and replace it with _self. 

This will prevent Samigo from escaping from the iframe. The student
will always have an easy way to return to the lesson. But what's in
the frame may be inappropriate or confusing both at the end of a test
and in some error situations.

OPTION 3:

There's another more aggressive fix that can be done without building
from source: Go to .../tomcat/webapps/samigo-app/jsf/delivery, look
for all .jsp files with _top in them, and remove the entire
h:commandButton XML object in which _top appears. That will produce
less confusion for the student, and is essentially equivalent to the
source patch.

For exanple, in beginTakingAssessment.jsp, remove this entire section.
The section starts with <h:commandButton and ends with />

 <h:commandButton accesskey="#{deliveryMessages.a_cancel}" value="#{deliveryMessages.button_cancel}" type="button"
    style="act" onclick="javascript:window.open('#{delivery.portal}/login','_top')"
onkeypress="javascript:window.open('#{delivery.portal}/login','_top')"
    rendered="#{delivery.actionString=='takeAssessmentViaUrl'}"
    disabled="#{delivery.actionString=='previewAssessment'}"/>

SAMIGO FIXES, part 2. ALLOW LESSON BUILDER TO EDIT ASSESSMENTS

Lesson Builder will let you create and edit items directly
from Lesson Builder. Tools other than Samigo have URLs Lesson
Builder can call to do this. Samigo does not. Thus I supply
a jsp that will add this ability to Samigo.

editLink.jsp should be installed as

tomcat/webapps/samigo-app/jsf/author/editLink.jsp 

You don't need source to do this. The jsp can be moved into
place once Sakai haS been installed. If you build from source
it can be put into the source tree as

.../sam/samigo-app/src/webapp/jsf/author/editLink.jsp

Once you've done this, you'll need to add this property
to sakai.properties:

   lessonbuilder.samigo.editlink=true

Without the property, Lesson Builder will call the 
Samigo main page when you ask to edit an assessment.


FLV PLAYER

Lesson Builder comes with two FLV players. The default is the Adobe
Strobe player. This has a BSD license, so it is safe for anyone to use.
The only problem is that it depends upon Flash 10. Alternatively, you
can use the JW FLV player. It should work back to Flash 8 (although not
if the content is H.264, which requires Flash 9). However it is licensed
with a CC non-commercial license. It is not clear who can use that.
If you're hosted by a commercial organization, you should check with
JW before using this.

Strobe player: http://www.osmf.org/strobe_mediaplayback.html
JW player: http://www.longtailvideo.com/players/

To enable the JW player, put the following in sakai.properties:

lessonbuilder.usejwplayer=true

I have also tried the OSFlv player. It's distributed under the GPL.
Aside from controversies involving the GPL, it doesn't do progressive
download, and the progress bar doesn't work for all users.

By default, Lesson Builder will use this player for MIME types
video/mp4 and video/x-m4v. However the players can handle additional
types. If you want to customize the list, you can set
lessonbuilder.mp4.types in sakai.properties to a comma-separated list
of MIME types, e.g.

lessonbuilder.mp4.types=video/mp4,video/x-m4v


OPTIONS FOR MULTIMEDIA SUPPORT

This section covers things you might need to do to support multimedia
options. These are not things I'm doing at Rutgers, and I don't think
you'll need them.

While I haven't seen the problem yet, in theory some player could get
confused by the fact that Sakai sets most multimedia types so they
download rather than play in line. If this becomes an issue I believe
the following in sakai.properties might help. This lists a reasonable
set of types as being inline. I do NOT suggest using this unless you
need it.

content.mime.inline.count = 7
content.mime.inline.1=video/mp4
content.mime.inline.2=video/quicktime
content.mime.inline.3=video/3gpp
content.mime.inline.4=video/x-ms-wmv
content.mime.inline.5=audio/mpeg
content.mime.inline.6=audio/wav
content.mime.inline.7=audio/x-wav

Lesson Builder has two ways to display multimedia content: IFRAME and
OBJECT. IFRAME is appropriate for web pages, OBJECT for videos, Flash,
etc. When a multmedia object is added we can normally tell its MIME
type. However if a URL is added, and for some reason we can't connect
to the server to look at it, we fall back to a check based on file
extension. The following extensions will be displayed with OBJECT:

  mp4,mov,m2v,3gp,wmv,mp3,swf,wav

Everything else will use IFRAME. You can change the list in
sakai.properties, e.g.

  lessonbuilder.multimedia.types=mp4,mov,m2v,3gp,wmv,mp3,swf,wav

If this property is present the list will override the builtin list,
so make sure you include those of the default types that you want
used. However this whole test should only rarely be used, because we
normally make decisions based on MIME types.

Lesson Builder uses icons for various resource types. It has its own
list of icons, in sakai-lessonbuildertool-tool/WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml 
When it doesn't have a specific icon, it will use generic Sakai icons.
If you prefer to use Sakai icons all the time, you may set

  lessonbuilder.use-sakai-icons=true

in sakai.properties

SECURITY ISSUE:

By default, Lesson Builder allows any HTML to be added using FCK.
I believe for this application it is important to let authors use
Javascript. If you don't like this, there are two ways to adjust it:

In sakai/local.properties, you can add

lessonbuilder.filterhtml=true|false

That will change the default.  For individual sites, in the admin
sites tool you can set the tool property filterhtml to true or false.
It defaults to "default", which will have no effect. If you set it
to true or false, that will override whatever the sakai.properties
sets as the default.

KERNEL BUGS:

If you want to be able to copy instances from site to site, you must 
install the fix for SAK-18616, if your copy of Sakai doesn't have it
already. You'll need SAK-19686 if you want the "Duplicate" function
in Site Info to properly copy Lesson Builder instances.

If you want import from archive to work, in 
common/archive-impl/pack/src/webapp/WEB-INF/components.xml
add to mergeFilteredSakaiServices
<value>LessonBuilderEntityProducer</value>

Restrictions on copying and importing:

* You should also copy resources, or you'll have dead links. And
  you should make sure you have the assignments and tests/quizes
  tools in your site if any of the page you're copying uses them.

* Currently assignments and assessments are not copied. Placeholders
  are put where an assignment or assessment was. They are fairly
  clearly labelled, and its easy to update the place holders to
  real items once you have your assignments and quizes published.

* If any units are hidden, that fact is not copied. This is 
  intentional. Copying typically copies data but not status.

------------------------------------------------------------------

The rest of this document has nothing to do with installation.
It's advice for people using Lesson Builder, primarily in the
area of multimedia content.

BROWSERS

I have tested on current (as of Nov, 2010) Mac Safari, Mac Firefox, XP
IE 6, Vista IE 7, Windows 7 IE 8, and iPhone Safari. Things should
work on all. The only misbehavior I see is that there are unnecessary
scroll bars on IE 7 for the dialog boxes. There are no
browser-specific hacks, so authoring should work on any browser that
supports jQuery. The student side uses very straightforward HTML, with
no jQuery, so it should work pretty much anywhere.

I have also tested with Voiceover (the Macintosh screen reader), and
slightly with JAWS 12.

While Firefox 2 seems to function, I've faked the buttons. jQuery's
buttons don't work with Firefox 2, and won't be fixed, because FF 2
is too old. See http://dev.jqueryui.com/ticket/5589. My current
hack works, but isn't as pretty as I would like.

The dialog boxes will fit themselves to the screen width, but they do
this when the page loads. So if someone loads a page and makes the
window narrower without redisplaying, the dialog boxes may be cut off
or scroll.

The application is intended to be accessible, to the extent that FCK
and jQuery are accessible. However it hasn't been tested for that.
Authoring supports alt tags and textual description, to make it easier
to author accessible content. However that requires authors that are
sensitive to accessibility.

The application is intended to be internationalized. Please tell me if
there are English strings that I haven't caught. There is
documentation in English. Pointer to that documentation are in
messages.properties, so you can supply a version in another language,
and have your version of messages.properties point to that version.
Note that the initial documentation is located in WEB-INF/resources,
which is referred to as classpath: in messages.properties, because of
how that file is loaded. The multimedia instructions are specified as
a location relative to the templates directory, because it is opened
from the HTML.


ISSUES [hints for authors having trouble]

If you set a quiz or assignment to have prerequisites, we modify the
setup of the quiz or assignment so that it can only be accessed
through Lesson Builder. Otherwise students could access it directly
through the Tests and Quizes or Assignments tools. Because the setup
of the quiz or assignment itself is changed, this means that all
references to that quiz or assignment must be consistent. That is, if
you use the same quiz or assignment in several lessons, all must be
set to have prerequisites or none must. (Similar controls are used
for Forums starting in the next version of Lsson Builder.)

There's one danger here: once we set the quiz or assignment to have a
prerequisite, we create a special group, and add the user to it as he
meets the prequisites. If the instructor goes into the tool, they'll
see the assignment as being released to a special group named "Access:
.....". if they modify the groups in the assignment, Lesson Builder's
prerequisite system will no longer work properly. It is possible to
change which groups can see an assignment, quiz or forum in Lesson
Builder itself. Once an item has been added to Lesson Builder, it is
best to adjust groups through the Lesson Builder "Edit". (This applies
to Assignments, Tests and Quizzes / Samigo, and Forums. It does not
apply to Mneme and jForum. Lesson Builder currently is not group-aware
for those tools.)

It's really nice to be able to include things like Flash and movies
in a lesson. Unfortunately it's surprisingly hard to make it work
for everyone. All students need the right plugins, and there may
still be random failures, depending upon the browser and other things.
Some problems I've seen are listed below.

The implication is that if you want to include multimedia content,
you'll need to do the following:

* Test it carefully in at least Firefox and the older version of
IE you intend to support (probably 6 or 7)

* Supply a unit at the beginning that shows tests of all formats
you will use, and gives instructions on installing the necessary
plugins.

* Give download links somewhere on the page for people who can't
see the embedded content.

You might consider verifying that the setup of each item is correct.
Except for Youtube content (which is always shown using the
recommended combination of tags), when you edit an object, the edit
dialog will show you (in a gray box) which tag is being used, and the
MIME type. If the MIME type is missing, this means that Lesson Builder
was unable for some reason to find the type. While Lesosn Builder will
normally guess the right way to handle it, if it doesn't you should be
able to fix it by correcting the MIME type. For the OBJECT tag, it's
safest to if the MIME type is specified. The browser will try to guess
it, but a missing MIME type may cause problems streaming some media
types.

The OBJECT tag normally used by lesson Builder for multimedia content
makes provisions for giving an alternate in case the normal player
fails. We use this provision. If the user doesn't have an appropriate
plugin, they will get a sensible message, and a download link. However
if they have the plugin but it doesn't work, they may end up with a
blank square where the content is supposed to be, and no error
message. This is most likely to happen with IE, but I've also seen it
with Safari.

Here are some notes on the kinds of failutres I've seen:

Some players will not play content if you are using SSL and the
certificate is invalid.

I saw one case where including a file from Resources failed, and it
worked when I made the file public. This shouldn't happen, and I
was unable to duplicate the problem.

The default width for multimedia types is 100%. In most cases this is
the safest default. However it is possible that with some players it
could result in the bottom not showing. You may have to adjust the
size of the player to be appropriate for the contents. Unfortunately I
don't know of any way to do that automatically for all content types.

Note that Flash, Quicktime and Windows Media will all scale the movie
to fit the space you have defined. This will probably result in the
movie being shown at a different resolution from the one at which it
was recorded. If you need more control over the details of how a movie
is shown, you can use "Add Text", and insert the file with the "Movie"
button in the HTML editor. This will result in HTML that is very
similar to what Lesson Builder uses in "Add Multimedia." Then you can
use the "Source" button to edit the HTML source, and add whatever
parameters you need.

I've seen an odd problem with Safari on the Mac. If you edit a Youtube
video, and change the URL, when the page updates the player isn't
there. If you refresh the page it works fine. I've checked the HTML
being sent carefully, and I'm pretty sure this really is a problem in
Safari. This is only a problem for the person creating the page. It
works fine for users.

I had Safari hang when adding a .mov (Quicktime) file from my local
system. I got a warning that the certificate was invalid. I said OK,
but the system got into a hung state. It just beeped, as it would if
there's a dialog box open that requires a response. But there wasn't
one. I was unable to duplicate the problem, probably because it
remembered that that URL was OK, and didn't ask again in the future.
This appears to me to be a bug in Safari or Quicktime.

IE does not implement embedding properly. If it is unable to display
the content inline the standards require it to display an alternate
message, which allows you to download the content. If it doesn't have
an appropriate player, it will do so. However if it does have a player
but there are problems using it, you'll get an empty box where the
content should be, with no sign of what went wrong. Among the possible
problems:

* security settings: Active X may need to be enabled. You may not get
any sign that this is the problem with IE, just an empty box where
your content should be.

* If the plugin needs to interact it may fail. E.g. after installing
Acrobat, the first time you need to accept the license. With Firefox
you are prompted to do this. With IE it simply gives you an empty box
where your content should be.

HOW MULTIMEDIA IS DISPLAYED

Here are details for people who want to understand how multimedia
content works:

There are three ways to show multimedia content, using HTML tags
OBJECT, EMBED and IFRAME. OBJECT is the newest, and is intended to
replace the other two. Lesson Builder will normally use OBJECT.
However OBJECT won't work with HTML content in IE, even IE 8.

NOTE: There are a lot of existing practices in handling multimedia
types that don't seem to make sense anymore. Lesson Builder is
trying to avoid reproducing old behavior that no longer makes
sense. However if you see any evidence that this approach isn't
working, I'd like to hear it. Note that the earliest browser I'm
willing to support is IE6, and I'd prefer not even that.

* I am not using EMBED, except for Youtube where I use exactly the
tags they recommend. I have tried a number of things in Safari,
Firefox, and IE 6, 7 and 8. I have seen no case where sticking an
EMBED inside an OBJECT is useful. When things fail in OBJECT they also
fail in EMBED, and using EMBED makes it harder to supply the
alternative error message and download link. I'd love to see an
instance where EMBED is needed.

* I am not using CLASSID. This is a Windows-specific way of specifying
which plugin to use. I am using the TYPE parameter in OBJECT. This
specifies the MIME type. That should let the browser pick whichever
plugin the user has installed for that MIME type. I haven't yet seen a
case where OBJECT with TYPE fails to find a plugin that's actually
there. If you know of cases where CLASSID is needed, and you've got
the MIME type correctly specified, I'd love to hear about it.

Because OBJECT won't work with HTML, we need to know what type of
content we're dealing with. By preference, we use the MIME type,
although we'll fall back to the extension if we can't get a MIME
type for some reason. For files in Sakai's resource area, that's
easy, because they have MIME type as part of the basic metadata. But
for URLs, we have to connect to the system at the other end and look
at the object. (Note that this extra connection is only done when you
add the object to a lesson, not every time it is used.)

If for some reason that connection fails, we look at the extension
field of the URL. E.g. http://foo.com/xxx.wmf will be assumed to be a
WMF file.

Here are the rules. If there is a MIME type:

* Use IMG for any type starting with image/

* If the URL is from cnn.com, and if we can recognize it as pointing
to a specific video, use a Youtube video player, with the same 
combination of OBJECT and EMBED tags that Youtube gives when
you ask it to give you the HTML for embedding.

* If the URL is not text/html (HTML) or application/xhtml+xml (XHTML),
use OBJECT. Pass the MIME type as the TYPE parameter in the OBJECT
tag. For mime types of video/x-flv, add OSFlvPlayer.swf to the URL,
since Flash Video uses a Flash-based player than an actual plugin.

* Otherwise, use an IFRAME.

If there is not a MIME type, the decision is based on the "extension",
i.e. the part of the file name or URL after the last period.

* Use IMG for the following extensions: bmp, gif, icns, ico,
jpg, jpeg, pgn, tiff, tif

* If the URL is from cnn.com, and if we can recognize it as pointing
to a specific video, use a Youtube video player, with the same 
combination of OBJECT and EMBED tags that Youtube gives when
you ask it to give you the HTML for embedding.

* If the extension is one of mp4,mov,m2v,3gp,wmv,mp3,swf,wav (this
list can be overridden), use OBJECT, but without the TYPE parameter.

* Otherwise, use an IFRAME.

Height and width for multimedia objects can be either a number of
pixels or a percent. CSS lengths, which can be actual lengths in
inches or cm, don't work with any player I've found.

URLs for www.youtube.com are handled specially. The TAGs currently
recommended by Youtube are used. The result should be a Youtube
player.

It's worth documenting the handling of youtube. We recognize any
URL that has v=NNNNNNNNNNN or v/NNNNNNNNNNN (also for internal
purposes v_NNNNNNNNNNN), where NNNNNNNNNNN is the 11-character
video ID. We construct appropriate URLs and embedding codes 
from the ID. This should work for URLs pointing to a specific
movie. It probably won't work for other URL, e.g. a URL to
a page like http://www.youtube.com/rutgers. Parsing is slightly
more flexible when you're changing an existing Youtube widget.
At that point we'll also allow you to paste the HTML embed code.
That won't work initially because it's not a URL. I haven't been
able to find official documentation for the structure of a Youtube
URL. If they change it, we could need to repair this code.

GPL NOTE: I am using OS FLV player for Flash Video (.flv) files. The
web site for OS FLV Player says it is covered by the GPL V3. The web
site has only one distribution, which as far as I can tell includes
the source, in the .fla file. (I'm not a Flash programmer, so I can't
verify it). The distribution does not include a copy of the GPL nor
any other license (not even a copyright notice). But the web site
points to a copy of the GPLv3. Thus I am warning you here that the
authors say it is covered by GPLv3. To avoid any questions, I'm also
ncluding here a copy of the original distribution, which they say
includes the source. That should make this distribution, and any
copies of Sakai that include it, compliant with the GPL. Their
original distribution is tool/src/OSFlvPlayer_v4.2.zip. Because the
player is a separate program which is loaded and executed by your
browser, I don't believe there are any issues of compatibility between
the GPL and the Sakai open source license.

EVENTS

Lessonbuilder reports several events:

lessonbuilder.read - whenever a page is read. It sets modified if the
page is complete, otherwise access.

lessonbuilder.create - creating a page or item

lessonbuilder.update - updating a page or item

lessonbuilder.delete - deleting a page or item

/DIRECT

The only useful function available via /direct is the ability to load
Common Cartridge files into a site.

To use it, POST a form with a single field, called "cartridge", containing the file.
Include parameters in the URL for the site and a session ID

Here's an example, with CURL:
   curl -F"cartridge=@/users/sakai/IMS_tests_v1.1/cc1p1vtd01v1p0.imscc;type=application/zip" "http://heidelberg.rutgers.edu/direct/lessonbuilder?site=2da97547-7031-4bca-8f18-c6f9517016b9&sakai.sessio\
n=bcacb865-8df0-40bf-b555-c5e660a23a46"

The file name after cartridge=@ is the ZIP file containing the cartridge
The site ID is the site into which to load it
The sakai.session is a session ID which you can get from looking at the JSESSIONID cookie. But remove any hostname from the end.
