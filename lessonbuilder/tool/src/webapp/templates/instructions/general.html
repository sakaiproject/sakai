<h2> STARTING OUT</h2>
<div class="textblock">
<p>We suggest that you start out by using <b>Add Text</b> to put material on this page. 
<p>Alternatively, you can use <b> Add Multimedia</b> for a Flash presentation, movie, etc.
<p> Then you can put links to additional resources, assignments for the unit, etc, by using the other buttons. If you place the mouse over a button you'll get a brief description of what it does. 
<p> Once you've added content, you'll find <b>Edit</b> buttons next to each item. They can be used to adjust the size of multimedia objects, to change the title, to add descriptive text, etc. They can also activate features that you can use to control the sequence in which items are available.

<h2> MORE ABOUT LESSON BUILDER PAGES </h2>

<div class="textblock">
<p> There are several ways to use Lesson Builder pages. Here are two
of the most common:

<ul>
<li> <b> Organizing material by topic or unit </b> - For major topics, which
you want to appear in the left margin, go to
<b>Site Info</b> and add a new instance of Lesson Builder using <b> Edit Tools</b>.
This process will ask you to supply a title for the new unit. You can change
the title later with the "Edit title" buttonn.
<p>
<li> <b> Organizing material within a topic </b> -  See Example 2 
in the right margin. We created pages to contain information about
the Camden, New Brunswick and Newark campuses, all linked to from the
same  main page. To create such a page, use the <b> Add subpage </b> button in
the toolbar at the top of the page.
<p>
Note that <b> Add subpage </b> puts you into the
newly created page, so you can add content. You can return to the current
page using links at the top of the page.
</ul>
</div>

<h2> Using pages in more complex situations </h2>

<div class="textblock">
<p> In many cases the two methods above are all you need. However
it is also possible to use lesson builder to build more complex
structures of pages. Here are a couple of approaches to doing that:

<ul>

<li> <b> Building a sequence of pages </b> Sometimes you want students to
go through a specific sequence of pages. Normally we recommend creating
the pages as subpages from a single main page, as in Example 2.
That makes it easy for students to review all of the material.
But if you want to push students to go through in a particular sequence,
you can add a link to the <b> next page</b>, typically at the bottom
of the page. If you do this several times, you will
build a sequence of pages.

<p> To add a <b> next page</b>, use <b> Add subpage</b>,
but select the option "next page". Typically you'll also
want to select "show as button". 

<p> Checking "next page" gives a page that won't normally return to the
current one.  (Of course the student can always get to any page
using the page index, unless you have restricted access to the page.)

<p> Checking "show as button" gives you a button rather than a link.

<p>
<li> <b> Going to different pages depending upon a student choice</b> 
See example 3 in the right margin.
Sometimes you may want to ask a question and have students go to a
different page depending upon how they answer the question. To do
that, ask the question using <b> Add text </b>, and then put two
<b> next page</b> items under it, going to different pages. To do
that, use <b> Add subpage </b> twice. 

<p> The options you use for <b> Add subpage </b> are up to you.
In example 3 we used "show as button" and "next page."

However two options are checked: "Next page" and "Show as button". Note that <b>Add subpage</b> lets
you create a new page or refer to an existing one.
