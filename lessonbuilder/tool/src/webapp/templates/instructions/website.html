<h3> ADDING CONTENT FROM PACKAGES SUCH AS CAMTASIA, WIMBA CREATE AND ARTICULATE</h3>

<p>
The "Upload Content from a ZIP File" dialog allows you to add content from a file.
There is specific support for Camtasia, Wimba Create, and Articulate, but
any ZIP file containing resources may be uploaded. Content will be uploaded into a folder
in Resources. Where possible a link will be added in the Lesson to the content.</p>

<p> 
In order for us to add a link to the content, we must be able to identify a 
particular file from the upload that is the "starting point."
The code can recognize this for certain common formats, including
Camtasia, Wimba Create, and Articulate. For other files, we will use index.html
or index.htm if it exists.</p>

<p> In other cases, Lessons will upload the content, but it will not add
an item. You may use "Add Content Link" or "Embed Content on Page" with "Choose Existing File" to locate files
that were uploaded and add them to your lesson.</p>
