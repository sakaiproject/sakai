Sakai LTI Internal Documentation
--------------------------------

Sakai has a unit test that we keep up-to-date with the latest LTi specifications.  It functions as both Consumer and Provider and exercises both standard services and Sakai's particular extensions.  I make this tool available online at

This folder contains the test plans for Sakai in the form of Excel spreadsheets above.

The developer/configuration documentation is in the form of Word documents:

* [Sakai API Documentation Including API Extensions](https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/raw/master/basiclti/basiclti-docs/resources/docs/sakai_basiclti_api.doc)
Sakai has API extensions for Membership/Roster, Learning Object Repository Integration, and a Settings service.
* [Configuring the Sakai External Tools Portlet](https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/raw/master/basiclti/basiclti-docs/resources/docs/sakai_basiclti_portlet.doc)
It is possible to make multiple pre-configured placements of the LTI Tool in a way that they are placeable as tools.
* [Configuring the Sakai LTI Provider](https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/blob/master/basiclti/basiclti-docs/resources/docs/sakai_basiclti_provider.doc)
It is possible to use Sakai tools as LTI tools that can be used in an LTI Consumer like a portal or other LMS.
* [Documentation for Vendors of Sakai Tools](https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/blob/master/basiclti/basiclti-docs/resources/docs/sakai_basiclti_vendor.doc)
This is CC0 licensed documenation that can be used to quickly develop vendor documnation showing how to configure a vendor's LTI 
tool in Sakai.
