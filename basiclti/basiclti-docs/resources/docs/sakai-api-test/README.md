The LTI 1.1 / 2.0 Test Harness
------------------------------

The code that was here for over a decade has moved.   This was accessible at 

    https://online.dr-chuck.com/sakai-api-test

And is now available at:

    https://www.tsugi.org/lti-test/

The new location for the source code is at

    https://github.com/tsugiproject/lti-test

The Sakai copy of this code and the online.dr-chuck.com version of this test harness
will no longer be supported.
