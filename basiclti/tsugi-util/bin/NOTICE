History of the License of org.tsugi code

The code in the package org.tsugi was originally written by 
Charles R. Severance and placed in the org.imsglobal package.
While the code was not owned by IMS Global, the copyright was 
IMS Global (and not Sakai Foundation or Apereo Foundation) to encourage
others to extract this code and put it into their own projects.

Paul Gray and others decived to pull the org.imsglobal code out from
the Sakai source tree and create a separate repository to make it simpler
for folks to make use of the code outside of Sakai.  This independent 
fork was done with the approval of Charles R. Severance.

In June 2015, Paul was asked to move the repository from his own personal
account into an IMS owned github repository:

	https://github.com/IMSGlobal/basiclti-util-java

This was also done with the apporval of Charles R. Severance

This made good sense as now IMS is now in posession of the code to 
produce those "org.imsglobal" artifacts.

The artifact in the Sakai repository has drifted away from that 
original fork as each repo has their own goals and objectivies.

This code was renamed "org.tsugi" and the copyright changed back to 
Charles R. Severance in order to avoid confusion with the IMS
artifacts with the same names.  

	https://jira.sakaiproject.org/browse/SAK-30308

The org.tsugi code for now co-evolves with Sakai's needs for LTI 2.x,
ContentItem, and other specs.  At some point in the future, the 
org.tsugi code might find its way into a separate repository so it
is simply referenced by Sakai. But until other customers develop for
code base - the code will remain in the Sakai repository.

Employment notes

While Dr. Charles R. Severance at times did hourly consulting for 
IMS Global during the time period he was working on this code, 
the effort on this code was never billed to IMS Global since 
IMS was not willing to support Sakai software development.  During 
the period 2012-2014 Dr. Charles Severance worked as a consultant 
paid by Blackboard explicitly supporting his involvement and 
contributions to Sakai.  Much of the LTI 2.0 code was built and 
paid for by BlackBoard with an Open Source Contribution Agreement 
with Sakai/Apereo.
