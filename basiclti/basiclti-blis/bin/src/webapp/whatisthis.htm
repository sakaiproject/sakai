<b>Configuring Simple Learning Tools Interoperability</b>
</p>
<p>The <b>Resource URL</b> is only used by some External Tools.  This is a URL
that is readible across the web.  An example URL might be to a publically 
downloadable IMS Content Package - which you are providing to the external
tool.
</p>
<p>All external tools support launch within an iFrame.  Some tools 
optionally support a widget launch.  A widget launch means that the tool 
produces HTML markup which will
be embedded directly in the page instead of in an iFrame.  
If you check the <b>Prefer Widget Launch</b>  option, the external tool will
be informed that your first preference is to use the in-lined 
widget approach.
</p>
<p>
The value you enter for <b>Preferred Width / Height </b> will be passed into the 
External Tool.  If the tool an be resized - it may adjust itself to be this size.
</p>
<p>
The value if <b>iFrame Height</b> sets the height of the iFrame if the launch
ends up being an iFrame launch.
