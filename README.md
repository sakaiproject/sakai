This is the "Mini Quick Start" for more complete steps to get Sakai configured please look at [this guide on the wiki](https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/wiki/Quick-Start-from-Source).

build it by running (or `./mvnw install` if you don't have Maven installed):
```
mvn install
```

## Running

Sakai runs on Apache Tomcat 9. Download the latest version from http://tomcat.apache.org and extract the archive.
*Note: Sakai does not work with Tomcat installed via a package from apt-get, yum or other package managers.*

You **must** configure Tomcat according to the instructions on this page:
https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/BOOT/Install+Tomcat+9

When you are done, deploy Sakai to Tomcat:
```
mvn clean install sakai:deploy -Dmaven.tomcat.home=/path/to/your/tomcat
```

Now start Tomcat:
```
cd /path/to/your/tomcat/bin
./startup.sh && tail -f ../logs.catalina.out
```

Once Sakai has started up (it usually takes around 30 seconds), open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/portal

## Accessibility
[The Sakai Accessibility Working Group](https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/2ACC/Accessibility+Working+Group) is responsible for ensuring that the Sakai framework and its tools are accessible to persons with disabilities. [The Sakai Ra11y plan](https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/2ACC/rA11y+Plan) is working towards a VPAT and/or a WCAG2 certification.

CKSource has created a GPL licensed open source version of their [Accessibility Checker](https://cksource.com/ckeditor/services#accessibility-checker) that lets you inspect the accessibility level of content created in CKEditor and immediately solve any accessibility issues that are found. CKEditor is the open source rich text editor used throughout Sakai. Whlie the Accessibility Checker, due to the GPL license, can not be bundled with Sakai, it can be used with Sakai and the A11y group has created [instructions](https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/2ACC/CKEditor+Accessibility+Checker) to help you.

## Translating Sakai

Translation, internationalization and localization of the Sakai project are coordinated by the Sakai Internationalization/localization community. This community maintains a publicly-accessible report that tracks what percentage of Sakai has been translated into various global languages and dialects. If the software is not yet available in your language, you can translate it with support from the broader Sakai Community to assist you. 

From its inception, the Sakai project has been envisioned and designed for global use. Complete or majority-complete translations of Sakai are available in the languages listed below.
