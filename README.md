# Sakai
This site contains some of the more technical notes/documentation aspects of the [Sakai Project](https://www.sakaiproject.org/).

There will be a couple of different directories:

* **Releases**- Each release will have its own page documenting the major changes (change-log).
* **Installation Instructions**- How-To's for installing Sakai on different platforms.

The site also contains some other aspects of the development process:

* **Contribution Guidelines**- How the community operates when dealing with development/code and bug/feature requests.
* **Downloads**- Links to version downloads and packages.
