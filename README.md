This is the source code for the Sakai CLE.

## Building

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sakaiproject/sakai.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sakaiproject/sakai)

This is the "Mini Quick Start" for more complete steps to get Sakai configured please look at [this guide on the wiki](https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/wiki/Quick-Start-from-Source).

To build Sakai you need Java 1.8 and Maven 3.2. Once you have clone a copy of this repository you can
build it by running:
```
mvn install
```

## Running

Sakai runs on Apache Tomcat 8. Download the latest version from http://tomcat.apache.org and extract the archive.
*Note: Sakai does not work with Tomcat installed via a package from apt-get, yum or other package managers.*

You **must** configure Tomcat according to the instructions on this page:
https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/BOOT/Install+Tomcat+8

When you are done, deploy Sakai to Tomcat:
```
mvn clean install sakai:deploy -Dmaven.tomcat.home=/path/to/your/tomcat
```

Now start Tomcat:
```
cd /path/to/your/tomcat/bin
./startup.sh && tail -f ../logs.catalina.out
```

Once Sakai has started up (it usually takes around 30 seconds), open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/portal

[Sakai 11.4](https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/DOC/Sakai+11+Release+Notes) is still supported. The possibility of a Sakai 11.5 is under review. It's recommended for anyone using this release to build from source off of the 11.x branch.

Sakai 10.0 and earlier are no longer supported by the community.

For full history of supported releases please see our [release information on confluence](https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/DOC/Sakai+Release+Date+list).

## Under Development
Sakai 12.2 is under development as the second maintenance release of Sakai 12. It is expected to be released in the Q3 July/August 2018 timeframe.

## Accessibility
[The Sakai Accessibility Working Group](https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/2ACC/Accessibility+Working+Group) is responsible for ensuring that the Sakai framework and its tools are accessible to persons with disabilities. [The Sakai Ra11y plan](https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/2ACC/rA11y+Plan) is working towards a VPAT and/or a WCAG2 certification.

CKSource has created a GPL licensed open source version of their [Accessibility Checker](https://cksource.com/ckeditor/services#accessibility-checker) that lets you inspect the accessibility level of content created in CKEditor and immediately solve any accessibility issues that are found. CKEditor is the open source rich text editor used throughout Sakai. Whlie the Accessibility Checker, due to the GPL license, can not be bundled with Sakai, it can be used with Sakai and the A11y group has created [instructions](https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/2ACC/CKEditor+Accessibility+Checker) to help you.

## Skinning Sakai
Documentation on how to alter the Sakai skin (look and feel) is here https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/tree/master/library

## Community (contrib) tools
A number of institutions have written additional tools for Sakai that they use in their local installations, but are not yet in an official release of Sakai. These are being collected at https://github.com/sakaicontrib where you will find information about each one. You might find just the thing you are after!
