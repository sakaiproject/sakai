To build Sakai you need Java 1.8 and Maven 3.2. Once you have clone a copy of this repository you can
build it by running:
```

```

## Running

Sakai runs on Apache Tomcat 8. Download the latest version from http://tomcat.apache.org and extract the archive.
*Note: Sakai does not work with Tomcat installed via a package from apt-get, yum or other package managers.*

You **must** configure Tomcat according to the instructions on this page:
https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/BOOT/Install+Tomcat+8

When you are done, deploy Sakai to Tomcat:
```
mvn clean install sakai:deploy -Dmaven.tomcat.home=/path/to/your/tomcat
```

Now start Tomcat:
```
cd /path/to/your/tomcat/bin
./startup.sh && tail -f ../logs.catalina.out
```

Once Sakai has started up (it usually takes around 30 seconds), open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/portal

## Under Development

## Accessibility
[The Sakai Accessibility Working Group] (https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/2ACC/Accessibility+Working+Group) is responsible for ensuring that the Sakai framework and its tools are accessible to persons with disabilities. [The Sakai Ra11y plan] (https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/2ACC/rA11y+Plan) is working towards a VPAT and/or a WCAG2 certification.

CKSource has created a GPL licensed open source version of their [Accessibility Checker] (https://cksource.com/ckeditor/services#accessibility-checker) that lets you inspect the accessibility level of content created in CKEditor and immediately solve any accessibility issues that are found. CKEditor is the open source rich text editor used throughout Sakai. Whlie the Accessibility Checker, due to the GPL license, can not be bundled with Sakai, it can be used with Sakai and the A11y group has created [instructions] (https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/2ACC/CKEditor+Accessibility+Checker) to help you.

## Community (contrib) tools
A number of institutions have written additional tools for Sakai that they use in their local installations, but are not yet in an official release of Sakai. These are being collected at https://github.com/sakaicontrib where you will find information about each one. You might find just the thing you are after!
