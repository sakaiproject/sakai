To build Sakai you need Java 1.7 and Maven 3.2. Once you have clone a copy of this repository you can
build it by running:

## Running

Sakai runs on Apache Tomcat 7. Download the latest version from http://tomcat.apache.org and extract the archive.

When you are done, deploy Sakai to Tomcat:
```
mvn clean install sakai:deploy -Dmaven.tomcat.home=/path/to/your/tomcat
```

Now start Tomcat:
```
cd /path/to/your/tomcat/bin
./startup.sh && tail -f ../logs.catalina.out
```
