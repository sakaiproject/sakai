<h2>Adding the Honor Pledge to an
assignment</h2>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this
document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a
basic understanding of roles and permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>The Honor Pledge requires students to affirm that they have neither
given nor received aid on an assignment. Students must click a
checkbox pledging this in order to submit the assignment.</p>



<p>To add the Honor Pledge to your assignment, near the bottom of the
assignment screen, check the <strong><code>Add honor pledge</code></strong> checkbox. You
may add the Honor Pledge to a new assignment or to one that you are
revising.</p>

creating an assignment, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbs">Adding, editing, or removing an assignment</a> or
<a href="content.hlp?docId=arbk">Posting an assignment previously saved as a draft</a>.</p>
