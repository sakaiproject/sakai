document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a

<p>To download grades from the Assignments tool to a spreadsheet, follow
these steps:</p>

<ol><li>In the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> of the relevant course or <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardt">project
site</a>, click <strong><code>Assignments</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>At the top of the page, click <strong><code>Grade Report</code></strong>.


<br /><br />
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Download Spreadsheet</code></strong>.
<br /><br />
</li><li>Depending on your web browser, you might be prompted to either
open the file or save it. Follow your web browser's prompts; if you
choose to save the file, you will have to locate it (e.g., on your
computer's hard drive) to open the spreadsheet.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The downloaded file will be in Microsoft Excel
(i.e., <code>.xls</code>) format.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>The spreadsheet contains students' usernames and full names in the
first two columns. Each subsequent column lists a different
assignment, and student grades are located in the corresponding cells
within each column. If no grade is present then "No Submission" is
displayed.  The spreadsheet does not tally assignment grades.</p>
