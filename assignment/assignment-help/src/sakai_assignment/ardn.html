<h2>Assignments: Overview</h2>


<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>For courses, the Assignments tool allows instructors to create,
distribute, collect, and grade online assignments. Assignments are
private; student submissions are not visible to other users of the
site.</p>

<p>The Assignments tool offers multiple grading options, including letter
grades, points, checkmarks, pass/fail, or ungraded.</p>

<p>Assignments can also be returned, with or without grades, for
re-submission. Instructors can download all submissions to an
assignment to their computer at once. When instructors release grades
for an assignment, students can access instructor comments and their
grades.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Student view:</strong> Clicking <strong><code>Student View</code></strong> allows
you as an instructor or site leader to view assignments as they would
appear to your students or project participants. To learn more about
using student view, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzj">Seeing how assignments look to participants</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Honor pledge:</strong> This option requires students to click
a checkbox affirming that they have neither given nor received aid on
an assignment before they can submit it.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>Instructors can return assignments and allow for
re-submission. This feature can be used to evaluate drafts of final
projects or papers, or to allow students to correct and re-submit an
assignment.<br /><br />
</li><li>The Assignments tool can post grades to the Gradebook. If you
choose this option, you won't be able to enter grades manually for
students who did not complete the assignment online. For more on the
relationship between the Assignments and Gradebook tools, see
