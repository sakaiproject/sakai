assignment is available for students to begin working on it. To send
an announcement alerting students to the start date, see step 4 below.
</li><li><strong>Due date:</strong> This is the assignment's deadline. To
list the due date on the course site's schedule, see step 4
below.
</li><li><strong>Accept until:</strong> No assignments can be
submitted after this date. You can set this date and time later than
the due date to continue accepting assignments (e.g., to allow for
revisions) after the due date.
</li><li><strong>Student submissions:</strong> You can choose to have
students submit their assignments inline only (typed directly into a
text box), as attachments only, or both.
</li><li><strong>Grade scale:</strong> There are five grading options you
can choose from: <strong><code>Ungraded</code></strong>, <strong><code>Letter grade</code></strong>,
<strong><code>Points</code></strong>, <strong><code>Pass/Fail</code></strong>, or <strong><code>Checkmark</code></strong>. If you
