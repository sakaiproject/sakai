<h2>Completing and submitting an
assignment</h2>






<p>Your instructor or project leader may set up assignments for you to
complete and submit online. To work on an assignment:</p>

<ol><li>Open the site for the course or project with the assignment.

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>, click <strong><code>Assignments</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Click the name of the assignment to open it.
<br /><br />
</li><li>To work on the assignment, follow the instructions from your
instructor or project leader. You may need to type something into the
text box, or perhaps add an attachment, or both.

<br /><br />
</li><li>To add an attachment, click <strong><code>Add Attachments</code></strong> in the
assignment window; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aupf">Options for adding attachments</a>.



<br /><br />
</li><li>If you'd like to see how your assignment will look to your
instructor or project leader, click <strong><code>Preview</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>If you want to save your assignment to complete later, click
<strong><code>Save Draft</code></strong> at the bottom of the screen. When you want to
reopen it, you'll find it listed in the assignment list with a status
of "In progress".

<p><strong>Note:</strong> While your assignment is saved as a draft, your
instructor cannot see it. For your instructor to see it, you must submit
the assignment.</p>
</li><li>When you have finished, click <strong><code>Submit</code></strong> at the bottom of the
screen.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Don't click <strong><code>Submit</code></strong> until you're
certain you're finished with an assignment. Once you click
<strong><code>Submit</code></strong>, you'll no longer be able to access the assignment
(e.g., to add more text or attachments) unless your instructor returns
it to you.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>You will receive an email message confirming your submission.  If you 
do not receive a confirmation email, check to see if you have successfully
submitted the assignment.  </p>
