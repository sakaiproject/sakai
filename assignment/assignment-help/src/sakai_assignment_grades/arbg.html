<h2>Checking a grade on an assignment</h2>

















<p>To check your grade on an assignment:</p>

<ol><li>In the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>, click <strong><code>Assignments</code></strong>. When the
Assignments page appears, you'll see the the title of your assignment
and information about its status.
<br />
<br /></li><li>Click the title of the assignment for more details. You'll see
when your assignment was graded as well as the original
instructions. Your instructor may have added comments to the text that
you submitted. If your instructor left additional comments, they will
be at the bottom of the page. You may need to scroll down to see them.

<p>In addition, your instructor may have added an attachment (or
attachments). You will see these below the instructor comments.</p>
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Back to list</code></strong> to return to the Assignments main page.

<p>
You may need to take further action (e.g., if your instructor has made
suggestions and asked you to resubmit the assignment). After you've
done the needed work, you can preview your changes, resubmit your
assignment, or save it as a draft.
