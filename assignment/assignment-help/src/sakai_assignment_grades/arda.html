<h2>Grading or returning an assignment or
reviewing student status</h2>















<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this
document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a
basic understanding of roles and permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<h3>Grading or returning an assignment</h3>

<p>You can grade an assignment with or without returning it to the
student, and you can return it with or without a grade.  The basic
steps are the same:</p>

<ol><li>In the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>, click <strong><code>Assignments</code></strong>. You will
see a list of assignments. The "In / New" column displays the number
of submissions that have come in from students (the "In" value) and
the number of new submissions (the "New" value) for each assignment.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Under the name of the assignment you want to grade, click
<strong><code>Grade</code></strong>. You will see the assignment along with student
submissions.

<br /><br />

<strong>Note</strong>: To enter the same grade for all students
without a grade, next to "Assign this grade to all participants
without a grade", select or enter a default grade, and then click
<strong><code>Apply</code></strong>.

<br /><br /> 
</li><li>To view a student's submitted assignment and start grading, click
the student's name.

<p>Under "Assignment Submission", you'll see the student's submitted
text. If applicable, under "Submitted Attachments", you'll see links
to files the student submitted.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If a student has saved an assignment as a
draft, you will still be able to grade the assignment
but you will be unable to see the text of the student's draft. You
will see a warning that the student may still be working on the assignment,
but you can enter summary comments and a grade just as you ordinarily
would.</p>
</li><li>To leave comments, you have the following options:

<br /><br />

<ul><li>You can add comments to the student's submitted text by enclosing
your comments in double curly brackets, for example:

<span class="example">  {{Cite your sources, please.}}</span>

<p>The student will see your comments appear in red.</p>
</li><li>Under "Instructor Comments", you can enter summary
comments in the text box (no special formatting is
required).
</li></ul><br />

</li><li>If you would like to add an attachment to give to the student,
click <strong><code>Add Attachments</code></strong>. For instructions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aupf">Options for adding attachments</a>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Next to "Grade", select the grade for the student's assignment, or
enter points in the box.

<br /><br />
</li><li>If you wish to allow the student to resubmit the assignment, check
<strong><code>Allow Resubmission</code></strong>, and use the drop-down menu to set the number of resubmissions allowed. Then, next to "Accept Until", set a resubmission deadline.

<br /><br />

</li><li>When grading is complete, click <strong><code>Return Assignment to
Student</code></strong> to make the student's assignment grade immediately
available, or click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to return to the submitted
assignments list to continue grading. Click <strong><code>Preview</code></strong> to see
how the returned assignment will look to the student, or click
<strong><code>Cancel</code></strong> to return to the assignment list.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can return assignments to students with or
without grades.</p>
</li><li>When you have finished grading student assignments and are ready
to send grades to the Gradebook, when viewing the list of submitted
assignments, click <strong><code>Release Grades</code></strong>.
</li></ol>

<h3>Reviewing student status for all assignments</h3>

<p>You can view a list of your students and see each one's status on each
of the assignments. You can see whether the student has submitted the
assignment, the assignment status, and the grade, if one has been
given.</p>

<ol><li>In the menubar, click <strong><code>Assignments</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>From the "View" drop-down list, select <strong><code>Assignment List by
Student</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
 </li><li>To view the status of a student's assignment submissions, click
the black arrow next to the student's name. To hide the student's
information, click the arrow again.
</li></ol>
