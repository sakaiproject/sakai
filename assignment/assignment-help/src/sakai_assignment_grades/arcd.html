<h2>Downloading assignment grades to a spreadsheet</h2>



 

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete these procedures, you
must be assigned a role having the necessary permissions.  To
determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>




<p>To download grades from the Assignments tool to a spreadsheet:</p>

<ol><li>In the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> of the relevant course or <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardt">project
site</a>, click <strong><code>Assignments</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>At the top of the page, click <strong><code>Grade Report</code></strong>.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the grades for an assignment have not been
released, they will not be displayed in the Grade Report, and they
will not be downloaded to the spreadsheet. To release the grades for
an assignment, from the Assignment List, click <strong><code>Grade</code></strong> under
the appropriate assignment. Near the top of the Submissions page,
click <strong><code>Release Grades</code></strong>. Click <strong><code>Grade Report</code></strong> to return
to the Grade Report page.</p>
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Download Spreadsheet</code></strong>.
<br /><br />
</li><li>Depending on your web browser, you might be prompted to either
open the file or save it. Follow your web browser's prompts; if you
choose to save the file, you will have to locate it (e.g., on your
computer's hard drive) to open the spreadsheet.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The downloaded file will be in Microsoft Excel
(i.e., <code>.xls</code>) format.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>The spreadsheet contains students' usernames and full names in the
first two columns. Each subsequent column lists a different
assignment, and student grades are located in the corresponding cells
within each column. If the assignment has not been submitted and no
grade is present, then "No Submission" is displayed; if it has been
submitted but not graded, the cell is blank.  The spreadsheet does not
tally assignment grades.</p>
