/**
 * Defines a relation between a submission and the submission's submitters.
 * <br/> - A submitter can have its own grade separate from the grade of the submission,
 * useful in providing user with different grades in group submissions.
 * <br/> - A submitter can have its own feedback separate from the feedback of the submission,
 * useful when different feedback is needed in group submissions
 * <p>
 * <b>Constraints</b>
 * <br/>- submission and submitter are unique,
 * meaning a user can't be a submitter more than once on a submission.
 * Notice that equals and hashcode also reflect this relationship.
