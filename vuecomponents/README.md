# Sakai Vue Components Project

## What is this project?

This is a collection of vue components which are compiled to webcomponents, that are globally availabe in Sakai.

## Vue Version

Currently we are using using vue 2. As soon as vue-cli or vite is ready to compile vue 3 components to a webcomponent bundle, we can upgrade to vue 3. Our components won't need much of updating, since there is really good compatibility between vue 2 and 3.
