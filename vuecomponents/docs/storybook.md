# Delevopment in Storybook

Storybook is a tool to explore, develop and document reusable components.

## Work in progress!

Storybook is not setup for vuecomponents yet, but it will be soon, including a tutorial on how to develop using storybook and how to document your components!

## Setup

To make use of storybook, you will need to have node installed on your mashine, just download the latest LTS form the [node website](https://nodejs.dev/download) or use a package manager.

Navigate to `vuecomponents/tool/src/main/frontend` and run `npm run storybook`. If you see an error message, try, if running `npm ci` fixes the problem
