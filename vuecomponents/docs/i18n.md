# Internationalization (i18n)

You can easyly internationalize your vue component with the i18n mixin.

## Create properties file

First, create a properties file with all the strings you need for your component. After building `vuecomponents/bundle` you should restart your tomcat if it was running, because the properties are loaded on tomcat startup.

Ideally set the same name for the properties file, as you name your component (`avatar.vue` => `avatar.propeties`).

## Use the i18n mixin

Then import `i18n-mixin.js` and set the name option in your component.

```js
import i18nMixin from "../mixins/i18n-mixin.js";
export default {
  name: "hello-world",
  mixins: [i18nMixin],
};
// references hello-world.properties
```

If name does not fit your usecase (if another properties file with your components name alreay exists for example),
then set i18nProps in data, and this will be used to reference your properties file instead

```js
import i18nMixin from "../mixins/i18n-mixin.js";
export default {
  name: "hello-world",
  mixins: [i18nMixin],
  data() {
    return {
      i18nProps: "another",
    };
  },
};
// references another.properties
```
