# Internationalization (i18n)

You can easily internationalize your vue component with the i18n mixin.

## Create properties file

First, create a properties file with all the strings you need for your component. After building `vuecomponents/bundle` you should restart your tomcat if it was running, because the properties are loaded on tomcat startup.

Also the first time you might need to execute "sessionStorage.clear()" in the browser's console for changes to take effect.

Ideally set the same name for the properties file, as you name your component (`avatar.vue` => `avatar.propeties`).

## Use the i18n mixin

Then import `i18n-mixin.js` and set the name option in your component.

```js
import i18nMixin from "../mixins/i18n-mixin.js";

export default {
  name: "hello-world",
  mixins: [ i18nMixin ],
};
// references hello-world.properties
```

If `name` does not fit your use-case (if another properties file with your components name already or you want to share one file across components),
then set `i18nBundleName` in `data`, and this will be used to reference your properties file instead

```js
import i18nMixin from "../mixins/i18n-mixin.js";

export default {
  name: "hello-world",
  mixins: [ i18nMixin ],
  data() {
    return {
      i18nBundleName: "another",
    };
  },
};
// references another.properties
```

When the mixin and the properties file is setup the bundle is accessible through the
`i18n` data property. Using the `insert` method you can also add insertions into the
translated string by adding them as parameters after the text like `this.insert(this.i18n["input_placeholder"], "John", 2, 7)`.

```properties
input_label=A sentence:
input_placeholder={0} has a house with {1} doors and {2} windows.
```

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <label>{{ i18n["input_label"] }}<label>
  </div>
</template>
```
