editUsersInstructions_shoppingAdmin=For the "Shopping Admin" column, you can select the checkbox next to the level/site you want this user to have control over setting shopping period settings for.  The nodes and children of the nodes you select for "Shopping Admin" will show up for the user in the "Shopping Period" link.
editUsersInstructions_siteAccess=For the "Site Access" column, you can select which level/site you want the user to have access to.  When you choose "Site Access", you must fill out what role the user will become when they visit that site or a site that under that level.  You also have the ability to choose which tools are restricted for this user by clicking the "Restrict Tools" link.  All child nodes will inherit their parents settings unless you have specifically overridden them.  The nodes and children of the nodes you select for "Site Access" will show up for the user in the "Delegated Access" link.  When you are done, click save or click cancel to undo all changes.
delegatedAccessInstructions=This page allows you to search through sites you have been granted access to.  You can search by site title, site id, instructor name, instructor id, instructor email, or site term, or you can use the tree structure below to find the site you want.  Click on the title of the site to jump to that site.
shoppingAdminInstructions=This page allows you to set the shopping period settings for the sites you've been granted permission to update.  To set the shopping period settings, you can select the checkbox next to the level/site that you want to set.  Note, you will only see a checkbox next to a node you have permission to modify.  First, when you select a node, you must set the "Authorization" setting.  The two options are "Public" and "Logged In".  "Public" means anyone can access this site and do not need to log in to shop in this site.  "Logged In" means users must log in first in order to shop in this site.  Next, you need to choose the role the user will become when they are shopping.  Finally, you need to set the dates during which the shopping period will be open.  By default, all tools are hidden to shoppers so you must specify which tools a shopper can access.  You can edit this list of viewable tools by clicking the "Show Tools" link.  All child nodes will inherit their parents settings unless the child node has been set with its own settings.  When you are done, click save or click cancel to undo all changes.
