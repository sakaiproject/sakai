# If an EID blacklist has been configured, blacklisted-eid should be set to
# an EID which would normally resolve against the directory, but which
# has been prohibited by the currently configured blacklist. If no
# value is assigned to this property, the corresponding integration tests
# will simply be skipped. If a value _is_ assigned, but the configured
# blacklist does _not_ reject the value, the corresponding integration tests
# will short-circuit and fail.

# blacklisted-password should be set to a valid password for the EID defined
# by blacklisted-eid. That is, were the value of blacklisted-eid not blacklisted,
# that EID would be able to authenticate using this password. If a blacklisted-eid
# is specified, but a blacklisted-password is not, corresponding integration tests
# will short-circuit and fail.



# An "invalid" user
