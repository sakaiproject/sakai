This file describes configuring Java for Kerberos for use with Sakai.

NOTE: To use this provider with an existing or new systemwide
configuration, contact your local administrator and/or follow the
steps in SYSTEMWIDE.txt. By default, most JDKs are NOT configured for
use with Kerberos.

By default, the provider provides authentication ONLY for existing 
accounts in the local Sakai user database (where Sakai EIDs and 
Kerberos principals are the same). If you wish to allow anyone with a 
valid Kerberos principal to use Sakai, follow the instructions below 
under ADVANCED OPTIONS.

In addition, to protect the integrity of your Kerberos password, the 
use of a secure Web front-end is HIGHLY recommended.

Throughout this document, ${sakai.home} refers to the directory that
contains Sakai's configuration information. By default, this is the
"sakai" directory at the top-level of your Tomcat installation (known
here as $TOMCAT_HOME). For more information on configuring
${sakai.home}, refer to the configuration documentation in the top-level
"docs" directory of the Sakai source tree.

**CHANGES TO CACHING MECHANISM**

This provider previously implemented a configurable, in-memory caching 
mechanism. By default, a user's successful authentication was valid 
for 5 minutes. This mechanism prevented WebDAV, which sends 
authenticates on every connection, from overloading local KDCs.

This internal caching mechanism is now DEPRECATED per:

http://jira.sakaiproject.org/browse/SAK-10227

Implementors using Kerberos for authentication MUST use the 
UserDirectoryService's central authentication cache, introduced in 
Sakai 2.5, to tune the longevity of their authenticated logins:

http://jira.sakaiproject.org/browse/SAK-13403

The default TTL for entries in the central cache is 2 minutes.

**GENERAL SETUP**

To use this provider using ${sakai.home}/sakai.properties:

1) Create a JAAS configuration file. A sample file -- sakai-jaas.conf 
-- with the following content is included:

/*
 * JAAS Login Configuration for Sakai 
 */

KerberosAuthentication {
	com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
		storeKey="true"
		useTicketCache="false";
};

The provider uses the KerberosAuthentication context by default; it 
can be configured by changing the loginContext parameter in the 
components.xml file described in Step 3. Each context name is unique 
and may not be duplicated.

The installation of this file is described in Step 4.

2) A test program (JaasTest.java) is available to confirm Kerberos 
authentication. To run it:

$ javac JaasTest.java
$ java -Djava.security.auth.login.config=sakai-jaas.conf \
 JaasTest KerberosAuthentication

LoginContext for testing: KerberosAuthentication
Enter a username and password to test this LoginContext.

Kerberos username [user1]: user1
Kerberos password for user1: foo
Authentication succeeded.

If authentication fails, contact your local administrator for help.

3) Uncommment the required dependency shown near "Needed for the
Kerberos Provider" in the "<dependency>" section of:

    providers/component/pom.xml

Then, uncomment the configuration section for the 
KerberosUserDirectoryProvider in:

    providers/component/src/webapp/WEB-INF/components.xml

After deployment, you can also edit this file:

$TOMCAT_HOME/components/sakai-provider-pack/WEB-INF/components.xml 

4) Once Sakai is deployed, copy sakai-jaas.conf to ${sakai.home} and 
then set options in ${sakai.home}/sakai.properties to configure the 
provider for use.

Three options control the behavior of this provider:

provider.kerberos.auth.login.config -- location of JAAS config file
provider.kerberos.krb5.conf -- location of krb5.conf
provider.kerberos.showconfig -- show extended config info (true/false)

Locations specified using the above options are used in place of the 
current system locations. Absolute path names are acceptable; if the 
file specified exists and is readable, it is used. Otherwise, the file 
path is assumed to be relative to ${sakai.home}. If no readable file 
is found, an error message is written to the log.

You MUST provide a value for provider.kerberos.auth.login.config 
unless you are using a systemwide configuration. Otherwise, all 
authentication will fail.

Examples:

provider.kerberos.auth.login.config=sakai-jaas.conf
provider.kerberos.auth.login.config=kerberos/sakai-jaas.conf
provider.kerberos.auth.login.config=/usr/local/sakai/sakai-jaas.conf

For general use. the last two options do not need to be specified. An
alternate Kerberos5 configuration file can specified using
provider.kerberos.krb5.conf; otherwise, the system default
(/etc/krb5.conf on Unix-based systems) is used. Setting the
provider.kerberos.showconfig option to "true" provides extended
configuration about the provider's settings in the catalina.out logs:

- Standard information (wrapped/edited for clarity)

INFO:
org.sakaiproject.component.kerberos.user.KerberosUserDirectoryProvider@1fd9cd5.init()
Domain=null
LoginContext=SakaiAuthentication
RequireLocalAccount=true KnownUserMsg=Integrity check on decrypted field failed

- Extended information (wrapped/edited for clarity)

INFO:
org.sakaiproject.component.kerberos.user.KerberosUserDirectoryProvider@1fd9cd5.init()
SakaiHome=/usr/local/sakai/sakai-demo/sakai/
SakaiPropertyKrb5Conf=null
SakaiPropertyAuthLoginConfig=kerberos/sakai-jaas.conf
SystemPropertyKrb5Conf=null
SystemPropertyAuthLoginConfig=/usr/local/sakai/sakai-demo/sakai/kerberos/sakai.jaas.conf

In the above, "null" entries indicate the use of systemwide defaults.

5) After startup, create a new Sakai account with your Kerberos 
principal as the user EID. You should then be able to login using your 
Kerberos password.

**VERIFYING KERBEROS SERVICE TICKETS**

Service-ticket verification was introduced in Sakai 2.7.

If someone has access to the network traffic between your Sakai 
deployment and the KDC, it is possible for them to fake responses 
from the KDC to indicate a successful authentication. They way to 
prevent this is to use the TGT to obtain a service ticket for a 
local service principal and then check that the service ticket is 
valid.

To setup this the first thing you need to do is to have a service 
principal created in the KDC, we have a service ticket for each 
node in our cluster and will probably be something like:

sakai-test/machine.inst.edu

You will probably want another principal to have rights granted 
on this service principal so you can create a keytab file for it.

Once the service principal has been created you should create the 
keytab file. This is normally done with the kadmin command. This 
is an example of creating the keytab file.

$ kadmin -p user/foo
Authenticating as principal user/foo with password.
Password for user/foo@INST.EDU: 
kadmin:  ktadd -k krb5-test.keytab sakai-test/machine.inst.edu
Entry for principal sakai-test/machine.inst.edu with kvno 3, encryption type AES-256 CTS mode with 96-bit SHA-1 HMAC added to keytab WRFILE:krb5-test.keytab.
Entry for principal sakai-test/machine.inst.edu with kvno 3, encryption type AES-128 CTS mode with 96-bit SHA-1 HMAC added to keytab WRFILE:krb5-test.keytab.
Entry for principal sakai-test/machine.inst.edu with kvno 3, encryption type ArcFour with HMAC/md5 added to keytab WRFILE:krb5-test.keytab.
Entry for principal sakai-test/machine.inst.edu with kvno 3, encryption type Triple DES cbc mode with HMAC/sha1 added to keytab WRFILE:krb5-test.keytab.
Entry for principal sakai-test/machine.inst.edu with kvno 3, encryption type DES cbc mode with CRC-32 added to keytab WRFILE:krb5-test.keytab.
kadmin:  quit

This will create a keytab file called krb5-test.keytab in the 
current directory.

To check what is in your keytab file you can use the klist command:

$ klist -ke krb5-test.keytab 
Keytab name: WRFILE:krb5-test.keytab
KVNO Principal
---- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   7 sakai-test/machine.inst.edi@INST.EDU (AES-256 CTS mode with 96-bit SHA-1 HMAC) 
   7 sakai-test/machine.inst.edi@INST.EDU (AES-128 CTS mode with 96-bit SHA-1 HMAC) 
   7 sakai-test/machine.inst.edi@INST.EDU (ArcFour with HMAC/md5) 
   7 sakai-test/machine.inst.edi@INST.EDU (Triple DES cbc mode with HMAC/sha1) 
   7 sakai-test/machine.inst.edi@INST.EDU (DES cbc mode with CRC-32) 

Now add an extra section to your JAAS configuration file changing 
values to account for local settings (principal and keyTab):

ServiceKerberosAuthentication {
	com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
		debug="false"
		doNotPrompt="true" // no username/password for this principal
		principal="--- Set this to match the service principal in test.properties, e.g., sakai-test/machine.inst.edu ---"
		useKeyTab="true"
		keyTab="--- Location of the keytab file for the service principal is, e.g., /home/user/krb5-test.keytab --- "
		storeKey="true" // store the key inside the subject
		isInitiator="false" // request a TGT? (JDK 6 only)
		useTicketCache="false";
};

Finally, configure the Kerberos provider to verify tickets by 
setting the service principal to use in sakai.properties:

servicePrincipal@org.sakaiproject.user.api.UserDirectoryProvider=sakai-test/machine.inst.edu

**TROUBLESHOOTING**

1) If you get an error message similar to this when attempting to 
get the Kerberos ticket granting ticket (TGT):

KDC has no support for encryption type (14) - BAD_ENCRYPTION_TYPE
		[Krb5LoginModule]: Entering logout
		[Krb5LoginModule]: logged out Subject

This you probably need to limit the encryption types in your 
system Kerberos configuation file (provider.kerberos.krb5.conf) 
with something like:

[libdefaults]
   default_tkt_enctypes = des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc des3-cbc-sha1

2) If when attempting to verify service tickets you see this 
message:

Checksum failed

then you may be using an old keytab file or if you have recently 
created a new keytab it may not have yet synced across all the 
KDCs.

3) If you have a stack trace containing lines like these when 
attempting to verify a service ticket:

Caused by: KrbException: Integrity check on decrypted field failed (31)
	at sun.security.krb5.internal.crypto.DesCbcEType.decrypt(DesCbcEType.java:154)
	at sun.security.krb5.internal.crypto.DesCbcMd5EType.decrypt(DesCbcMd5EType.java:33)
	at sun.security.krb5.internal.crypto.DesCbcEType.decrypt(DesCbcEType.java:125)
	at sun.security.krb5.internal.crypto.DesCbcMd5EType.decrypt(DesCbcMd5EType.java:33)
	at sun.security.krb5.EncryptedData.decrypt(EncryptedData.java:168)
	at sun.security.krb5.KrbApReq.authenticate(KrbApReq.java:267)
	at sun.security.krb5.KrbApReq.<init>(KrbApReq.java:134)
	at sun.security.jgss.krb5.InitSecContextToken.<init>(InitSecContextToken.java:79)
	at sun.security.jgss.krb5.Krb5Context.acceptSecContext(Krb5Context.java:724)

Then you may be using an encryption type that isn't supported. 
Try restricting the algorithms used when generating the keytab 
with something similar to:

$ ktadd -k krb5-test.keytab -e \
	"des-cbc-md5:normal des-cbc-crc:normal des3-cbc-sha1:normal" \
	sakai-test/machine.inst.edu@INST.EDU

**ADVANCED OPTIONS**

The Kerberos UserDirectoryProvider takes 6 configuration properties in 
its components.xml:

loginContext -- the name of the JAAS LoginContext to use
requireLocalAccount -- require a local account to login (true/false)
knownUserMsg -- error message used to determine valid Kerberos principal
domain -- the 2nd-level domain name of the user's e-mail address
serviceLoginContent -- the name of the JAAS LoginContext to use when verifying service ticket (optional)
servicePrincipal -- the name of the service principal to verify service tickets against (optional)

In addition, all of the properties can be set in the sakai.properties
file by specifying a value in this format:

<PROPERTY>@org.sakaiproject.user.api.UserDirectoryProvider=<VALUE>

To allow anyone with a valid Kerberos principal to login into 
Sakai without a local account, you MUST configure the 
"requireLocalAccount", "knownUserMsg", and "domain" properties.

To do so:

1) Determine the error message to be used by passing a valid Kerberos 
principal and an INCORRECT password to the JaasTest application:

$ java -Djava.security.auth.login.config=sakai-jaas.conf \
 JaasTest KerberosAuthentication

(NOTE: for systemwide configuration testing, use:
	$ java JaasTest KerberosAuthentication
)

LoginContext for testing: KerberosAuthentication
Enter a username and password to test this LoginContext.

Kerberos username [user1]: user1
Kerberos password for user1: foo
Authentication failed.

Error message
 --> Integrity check on decrypted field failed (31) - PREAUTH_FAILED

In this case, we'll use "Integrity check on decrypted field failed" as 
the string to compare (the provider compares the first part of the 
string).

2) In:

    providers/component/src/webapp/WEB-INF/components.xml

configure the settings or provide values for 
"requireLocalAccount", "knownUserMsg", and "domain":

<property name="requireLocalAccount"><value>false</value></property> 
<property name="knownUserMsg"><value>STRING</value></property>
<property name="domain"><value>DOMAIN</value></property> 

where STRING is replaced by "Integrity check on decrypted field 
failed" (the default, culled from RFC 1510) and DOMAIN is the 
2nd-level domain name of the user's e-mail address.

These properties can also be specified in the sakai.properties file as
noted above.

NOTE: Starting in Sakai 2.7, the default value for the "domain" 
property is NULL. If "requireLocalAccount" is set to "true", a 
value for the "domain" property MUST be set or Sakai will halt at 
startup.
