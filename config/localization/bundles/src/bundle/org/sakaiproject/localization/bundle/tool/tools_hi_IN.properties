# This file provides English language example of how to over-ride tool titles
# and descriptions for another language/locale. In order to translate:
#
# 1. copy this file to a locale-specific file (e.g. tools_fr_CA.properties)
#    (unless it already exists)
#.2. Translate into ascii-encoded UTF-8 characters
#
# Note these definitions over-ride the default title and description in the tool registration files
#

# Sample Tool Group Names (see toolOrder.xml, SAK-16600)



# Home is a special case, with no tool registration file

sakai.postem.title=PostEm

# Contrib tools
