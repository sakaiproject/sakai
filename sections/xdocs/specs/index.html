<h3>User and Sectioning Tool Project Statement and Functional Requirements</h3>
<h3><strong> (DRAFT -- SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REVISION. )</strong></h3>
<p><a name="home"></a><a href="#def">Definitions</a>| <a href="#scope">Scope statement</a>| <a href="#out">Out of scope</a>| <a href="#dep">Dependencies</a>| <a href="#roles">Roles</a>| <a href="#reqs">Functional Requirements</a></p>
<h3>I. Definitions<a name="def"></a></h3>
Because a user and group/section management tool is related to a wide range of administrative functionality and reliant on multiple framework services, there is significant room for misinterpretation and misunderstanding of key concepts. To help reduce potential confusion, the  following terms and definitions should be kept in mind while reading this document:
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Courses</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Course</strong> -- An instance of a canonical course, e.g., Math 16B Fall 2005 and the associated roster of students, instructors and section leaders. Class might be a more precise and distinctive term, but course seems to have wider usage in this context. Course is also preferred to the more general &quot;worksite&quot; here, although they should be considered equivalent to each other for purposes of this document.<br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Section</strong>  -- A subset of students in a class that usually meet under the guidance of a section leader. Section metadata and memberships may be aligned with or may be defined by enterprise  data from an outside system. In many cases all students in a course must belong to one or more types of sections (but are not allowed to be in more than one section of any type). There are roughly 4 types of section scenarios:
    <br />    
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Externally defined, externally controlled formal sections</strong> -- Section metadata and memberships  are defined and maintained in enterprise systems outside of Sakai.</li>
      <li><strong>Externally initialized, internally manged and negotiated formal sections</strong> -- Section metadata and memberships are defined wholly or in part in enterprise systems outside of Sakai, but can be managed and modified inside of Sakai [This type will <strong>not be supported</strong> in 2.1] </li>
      <li><strong>Internally defined, internally controlled formal sections</strong> -- Section metadata and memberships are defined and managed in Sakai, but are usually aligned in some respects with &quot;official&quot; sections, e.g., the meeting location.</li>
      <li><strong>Internally defined, internally controlled informal sections</strong> -- An ad hoc <strong>group</strong> or subset of students in a course. This group may have one of a variety of functions: study groups, project team, etc. The group may or may not have a section leader. [This type will <strong>not be directly supported</strong> in the sectioning tool. However, the boundary between a formal and informal Internally defined, internally controlled section is largely related to workflow. In other words, the ability to create formal sections should allow many instructors to meet their needs for ad hoc groups.] <br />
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>Framework and Services</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Section awareness</strong> -- Essentially, the ability to restrict or expand selectively what the members of a section, in terms of their roles, can do within the context of a course site. Role permissions vis a vis sections might be defined at the system level.<br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Hierarchy</strong> -- A term that came to  cover what has subsequently been broken out into the services that support, among other things, section management and awareness, and, by extension, came to represent sectioning itself. <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>SuperStructure</strong> -- 


 The new Sakai common services that support site hierarchies, context, and authorization across the framework.<br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>AuthZ</strong> -- Controls who can do what where. For example, Sarah is the Section Leader for sections 1 and 3. Sarah can view and grade only the students in her sections. Superstructure,  by providing the who and where,  helps enable these controls.<br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Course Management API</strong> -- Provides the course data -- name, course id, course roster, section names, section leaders, students in a section etc. -- to the various Sakai tools that use that information. This information can be entered  into the system manually or it can be transferred into the system from other enterprise applications. How Course Management works with AuthZ and Superstructure  is an open question.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#home">Back</a></p>
<h3>II. Scope statement<a name="scope"></a></h3>
<p>The primary deliverable for this subproject is a a new Sakai administrative tool that allows authorized users to create course sections/groups and/or manage section/group metadata and memberships. The tool will be available to authorized users for each course site from the standard toolbar.  Tool design, development, integration and final QA will be completed by 10/29/05.</p>
<p><a href="#home">Back</a></p>
<h3>III. Out of scope<a name="out" id="out"></a></h3>
<p>The sectioning tool represents a fundamental shift in Sakai's administrative capabilities. The introduction of sectioning into the overall Sakai administrative workflow is a major change to the application that should entail a review and redesign of the administrative tools in My Workspace and Admin Workspace in addition to any changes made at the course site level within Site Info. Instead, the twin constraints of time and resources demand that the subproject keep the outside impact of the new tool to a minimum.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Any required changes to  administrative areas outside of the existing functionality within the Site Info area that is subsumed by the new sectioning tool are out of scope. Resources outside of the subproject team must be allocated to fully identify any impacts and to do the contingent design and development work. See dependencies.</li>
  <li>The incorporation of &quot;section awareness&quot; in other Sakai Tools is out of scope. Resources outside of the subproject must be allocated to do any design and development. See dependencies.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#home">Back</a></p>
<h3><strong>IV. Dependencies<a name="dep"></a></strong></h3>
<p>1. In order to complete the sectioning tool by the October delivery date, the following framework services should be implemented, integrated and tested at a point early enough for the developers to build the tool on those services. Schedule TBD. This work must be closely coordinated with the subproject's technical lead. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Superstructure. This is finished and implemented, but unintegrated and untested. This is required to establish the hierarchy among courses and sections.</li>
  <li>AuthZ. This is finished and implemented, but unintegrated and untested. There also seems to be some disagreement on the architecture team about the adequacy of the design of the service.</li>
  <li>Course management. Finished, but only partially implemented. Is not using Hibernate.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.  There must be at least one tool that uses the sectioning tool's management capabilities or there will be no relevant context for the sectioning. The section aware tool(s) will be </p>
<ul>
  <li>Tests and Quizzes</li>
  <li>Gradebook</li>
  <li>Announcements</li>
</ul>
<p>UI elements and other code developed for the sectioning tool should be re-usable for other section aware tools.</p>
<p>3. There must be a new OOTB generic Sakai role that parallels Maintain and Access, but which is scoped at the section level. Without it, OOTB pieces of Sectioning Tool functionality will be rendered superfluous. Put another way, without this new generic role, anyone who deploys Sakai would first have to create a role for managing sections before using the Sectioning Tool OOTB in a fully meaningful way. Please see Section V below. </p>
<p>4. Any other required changes to My Workspace and Admin workspace. TBD.</p>
<p><a href="#home">Back</a></p>
<h3>V. Roles <a name="roles" id="roles"></a></h3>
<p>Three roles will be supported :</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Instructor</strong> -- Usually a professor, lecturer or teaching assistant who is a member of a course and who has fulll administrative control of the course site and sections/groups. S/he has access to all sections/groups.<br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Section Manager</strong> -- A teaching assistant, graduate student instructor or faculty member with limited administrative access to and control of sections within the section aware tools. Within the Sectioning Tool itself, the Section Managers will be able to:
    <ul>
      <li> edit section metadata (except for section category) for  their sections</li>
      <li> view and manage student memberships in all sections<br />
      </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Student</strong> -- A member of a course and possibly of a section(s) and/or group, but not in an administrative or instructional capacity for sections. Within the Sectioning Tool itself, the Students will be able to:
    <ul>
      <li>View section metadata for all sections</li>
      <li>Depending on Instructor preferences, join and switch sections </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>

  </ol>
<p><strong>B. Student Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Note: Ben added &quot;Student creates a new group&quot; to the use case goals. This begs the question &quot;When does a student join the ranks of the 'Authorized Users' above? which of the above functional requirements are transferable?&quot; I have left this use case out for the time being. </p>
<p>1. <u>Viewing and manipulating section data </u></p>
<ol type="a">
