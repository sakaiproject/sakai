<h2>Section Info: Overview</h2>
<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>The Section Info tool provides a way for instructors to efficiently
manage sections of a class. The tool is designed to help an instructor
manage a course that may consist of lectures, labs, discussions,
studio work, recitations, or any combination thereof.</p>

<p>The Section Info tool is designed to work with other tools, such as
Announcements, Gradebook, and Tests &amp; Quizzes.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Sections:</strong> This tool allows you to create sections
in a <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardt">course site</a>. Information you may add about a section includes
days, time, assigned teaching assistant, room, current enrollment,
available slots, maximum enrollment, and the section category.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Depending on your implementation, you may
have the option to automatically or manually manage section membership
from the Options page in the Section Info tool. Membership information
can be based on official registration information, or you can
discontinue section and membership updates from the registration
system and manually control everything. However, when you select
manual mode and then return to automatic mode, you will lose all the
changes you made while in manual mode.</p>

<p><strong>Groups:</strong> Groups function much like
sections. However, groups are managed through the Site Info tool, and
they do not have the associated metadata that a section may have.
Groups are never preloaded with official course data.</p>

<p><strong>Section categories:</strong> Choose from several options
for the type of section you wish to add. Categories include Lecture,
Discussion, Lab, Studio, and Recitation.</p>


<p><strong>Teaching assistants (TAs):</strong> In a course site, you
may assign TAs to each section. You assign a site participant the role
of teaching assistant through Site Info.</p>

<p><strong>Set announcements for sections:</strong> You may set an
announcement to be viewable only by a specific section.  When you
create a new announcement, choose from the drop-down menu which
section should see the announcement.</p>

<p><strong>View Gradebook by section:</strong> To view the Gradebook
by section, in the Gradebook tool, choose from the drop-down menu the
section you wish to view.</p>

<p><strong>View Tests &amp; Quizzes by section:</strong> You may view
different assessments you have created by section by choosing the
section in the drop-down menu.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>It is not currently possible to combine multiple courses into one
"master" course, though this is under consideration as a future
development. Groups and sections allow you to manage subsets of one
course, but it is not yet possible to combine several courses into a
superset.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Groups are very similar to sections, but differ in some key ways.
For more information, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=asyh">Difference between sections and groups</a>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>A teaching assistant may only edit information for students in the
section to which the assistant is assigned.

<br /><br />
</li><li>The role of teaching assistant is not available in a project site.

<br /><br />
</li><li>A section may have any number of assigned teaching assistants.

<br /><br />
</li><li>You have the option to allow students to switch or sign up
for sections.

<br /><br />
</li><li>A participant may not be a member of more than one section in a
given category.

<br /><br />
</li><li>A section may have any number of assigned teaching assistants.
