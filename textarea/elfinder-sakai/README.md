# elfinder Sakai

This is a WIP for connecting Sakai to elfinder. It builds on an existing project that provides the web endpoint
and has an API that filesystems can implement. It's currently not working but it almost there. There is no
integration into normal Sakai tools yet, in development I have been logging into Sakai and then just using a
static copy of elfinder served up by the application.

You need to have built a copy of https://github.com/bluejoe2008/elfinder-2.x-servlet and have it's artifact in your
local maven repository.

This isn't yet quite working but it starts up and is almost there.


# TODO

Disable search as it's not implemented yet.
