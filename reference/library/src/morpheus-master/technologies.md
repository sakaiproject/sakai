# What you need about Morpheus technologies

## SASS and Libraries
​
To move easily between on the folder structure and classes of Morpheus you need to have at least a notion of CSS. To make Morpheus possible, we have been using SASS because it provides more speed and freedom to the developers using their variables, nesting and inherited classes. You can find all SASS documentation in their official website [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
​
Also, for some of the structures we've been using the new way of CSS3 display, flex-box. The most complete tutorial we've found (we are using it as a cheat sheet) is in here [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
​
Inside Morpheus you can find also the strength of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) to make developers more comfortable if they already know this tools.
