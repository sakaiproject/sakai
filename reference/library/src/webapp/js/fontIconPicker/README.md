The Sakai FontAwesome Icon Picker
---------------------------------

These are files to support the FontAwesome icon picker.  They are adapted from:

   https://github.com/micc83/fontIconPicker

As forked to:

   https://github.com/csev/fontIconPicker 

I renamed the version to be 2.0.1-cs to indicate that this is a slightly
modified version of the 2.0.0 code to make it internationalizable and
more friendly to the latest release of FontAwesome
