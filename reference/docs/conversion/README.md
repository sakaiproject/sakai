For the most up-to-date conversion scripts please see the files in https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/tree/master/reference/docs/conversion

You should be able to check just this directory out with subversion using the command:

`svn co https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/trunk/master/reference/docs/conversion`

Or just clone it in github.

You need to run all scripts in order to ensure a proper conversion. For instance if upgrading to 11, if you're on 10.3 you need to see if scripts exists for 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, etc before running the 11 script. See this guide for more information: https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/DOC/Sakai+upgrade+information
