                                quick way to drop the Sakai application bundle into place without
                                requiring a maven build. This may be a good choice if you know you

            <para>The Binary installation of Sakai provides a shortcut for those that already have
                Tomcat in place and configured as needed (see <link linkend="install-env">Set up

                providing a pre-built Sakai that can simply be dropped into place. All you need to
                do is unpack the binary archive at the root Tomcat directory, and the appropriate
                wars, jars, etc., will be deposited in the correct locations.</para>
            <para>If you wish to configure a binary installation you'll need to manually create a

                hold your <filename>sakai.properties</filename> file, as described in <link

            <para>Since there have been a number of changes in tools, DB schema, and APIs, migrating

                        <para>The 2.2 framework refactoring means that many package names have
                            changed, and these differences will mainly be encountered in

                            instead start with the sample in

                            customizations you may have done, and you may need to alter them for
                            your situation. See the <link linkend="install-dbconfig">Database

                            in your schema, and attempt to introduce them. If you have already

                            to avoid running the portions of the conversion scripts that pertain to
                            them. Again, see the <link linkend="install-dbconfig">Database

                            to account for this, along with changes to its import statements and

                <title>JRE vs. JDK vs. J2SE vs. J2EE</title>
                <para>If you're unfamiliar with the Java world, you may find the acronyms for
                    various Java environments a little mysterious. The JRE is simply the "runtime
                    environment" which allows you to execute compiled Java bytecode, and for many
                    platforms this is all you usually get - for the very good reason that the
                    average user just wants to run programs, and doesn't need to be building code.
                    For this latter purpose you'll need the JDK, which stands for "Java Developer's
                    Kit." The J2SE (the "Java 2 Standard Edition") is simply the combination of the
                    JDK and the JRE - this is the one you want in order to complete the source
                    installation.</para>
                <para>If you go to the Sun site for a download, you may also run across the J2EE
                    (the "Enterprise Edition"), or even the J2ME (the "Micro Edition"). Don't
                    trouble yourself with these, unless you know of a particular reason why you may
                    want them - neither is necessary for a Sakai installation.</para>

            <para>There are three Java environment variables you'll want to set for everything to
                function as it should, and though some of them may have already been set by your

                all. You can also look at the <link

                <para>Windows users have the option of either downloading an .exe Tomcat installer

                    details, and for brevity's sake it's recommended that you grab the .zip. Sakai
                    requires some tuning of the JVM, and the service install manages these settings
                    through the registry rather than environment variables (see Tomcat installation

            <para>Sakai supports UTF-8, allowing for non-Roman characters, but this requires that
                Tomcat be configured to accept UTF-8 URLs since it ships with ISO-8859-1 as the
                default URL encoding. To change this setting, edit
                    <filename>$CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml</filename>. Add the attribute
                    <command>URIEncoding="UTF-8"</command> to the &lt;connector&gt; element.

enableLookups="false" redirectPort="8443" acceptCount="100" debug="0" 
connectionTimeout="20000" disableUploadTimeout="true" URIEncoding="UTF-8"/&gt;</screen>
            <para>If you want to run Tomcat on different ports than the defaults, this would also be

                minor change that may spare some confusion later. The <filename>ROOT</filename>
                webapp is the one served up when a request is made to your Tomcat's root URL, and so
                if you want users to be re-directed automatically to the Sakai application, you'll
                want to insert an <filename>index.html</filename> file into
                <filename>webapps/ROOT</filename> that prompts this re-direction. It should look

                    up, and so if your build output complains of "Out of Memory" errors you'll need
                    to set an additional environment variable, namely,
                    <command>MAVEN_OPTS</command>. The value in the sample Unix command below should

            <para>You will probably be able to start up Tomcat and run Sakai with the default

            <para>Sakai needs to be set up for two email functions: receiving email sent to Sakai
                sites, and sending out email notifications. For sending mail Sakai needs the address
                (name or IP) of an SMTP server that will accept mail from Sakai, and this needs to
                be set in your <filename>sakai.properties</filename> file:</para>
            <screen>smtp@org.sakaiproject.email.api.EmailService=some.smtp.org</screen>
            <para>To enable Sakai to receive mail you'll need to set the following:</para>
            <screen>
# dns addresses used for incoming email	
smtp.dns.1 = 255.255.255.1	
smtp.dns.2 = 255.255.255.2
                        
# SMTP port on which our SMTP server runs. Default is 25.
#Recommend running on 8025, and using a standard mailer on 25 to forward mail to Sakai.

                and would rather run a standard mailer like postfix on port 25 and configure it to
                forward requests to Sakai. You might also already have a mailer service running on
                port 25 (Linux usually has it running by default), and so you'd want to change the
                James port simply to avoid a conflict. For example:</para>

                <para>JVM tuning is, as a general rule, something of a black art, and we recommend
                    that you take the time to experiment with different memory and garbage
                    collection settings and see what works best in your environment. We can make
                    some minimal recommendations that should serve as a foundation for further
                    experimentation and testing, but the following details are however offered only
                    as samples or suggestions, and we recommend that you consult a systems
                    administrator or local Java guru before making any such changes to a production
                    system. See the <link

                    details.</para>
            </note>
            <para>The standard way to control the JVM options when Tomcat starts up is to have an
                environment variable <command>JAVA_OPTS</command> defined with JVM startup options.
                Since any given Sakai instance may be deployed for a variety of purposes - ranging
                from developers doing private testing to large-scale deployments - it's hard to
                recommend a single set of such options as the preferred ones for every case. We can,
                however, start with a bare minimum which will at least avoid "Out of Memory" errors,
                and be suitable for developer installs of the software:</para>
            <screen>
JAVA_OPTS="-server -Xmx512m -Xms768m -XX:PermSize=128m -XX:MaxPermSize=196m -XX:NewSize=192m -XX:MaxNewSize=384m"</screen>
            <para>This is an adequate - if minimal - starting point: it selects server mode, sets an
                adequate heap size, and sizes the permanent generation to accommodate more
                longer-persisting objects. These settings will allow things to be functional for
                testing and development, but will hardly be adequate for serving large numbers of
                concurrent users. A more suitable production environment on a 32-bit machine with
                multiple processors might use a set of options like:</para>
            <screen>
JAVA_OPTS="-server -Xms1500m -Xmx1500m -XX:NewSize=400m -XX:MaxNewSize=400m -XX:PermSize=128m 
-XX:MaxPermSize=196m -verbose:gc -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+UseParNewGC"</screen>
            <para>This is better: a larger heap size is set for smoother performance (we have found
                the best results when the min and max memory settings - Xms and Xmx, respectively -
                are set to be the same values), and garbage collection messages are turned on.
                Another important consideration is the ratio of <emphasis>NewSize</emphasis> to the
                size of the heap. We want as large a <emphasis>NewSize</emphasis> as we can fit in
                the total heap, while keeping the total heap significantly bigger than
                    <emphasis>NewSize</emphasis> in order for Java to properly garbage collect. The
                last two arguments above can produce a performance improvement if you have two or
                more processors on your machine, however your performance will be better if you
                don't include them for single-processor machines.</para>
            <para>As you can see, there's a lot to think about here, and in practice each
                implementing institution uses their own particular <command>JAVA_OPTS</command> that
                they've settled on for their deployment and hardware, and they often use more option
                arguments than we've shown here. This discussion is meant only as a head start, and
                there is no replacement for doing your own testing.</para>
            <para>Once you set <command>JAVA_OPTS</command> Tomcat will see this environment
                variable upon startup and use it. Instead of putting this in an environment variable
                you might create your own startup script to do so.</para>

                <para>Windows users that have installed Tomcat as a service may set Java options in

                    permanent generation settings mentioned above will not work appropriately if set
                    in the "Java Options:" field of the dialog window. That's because these settings
                    have their own fields in the properties GUI, under the headings
                        <emphasis>Initial Memory Pool</emphasis> and <emphasis>Maximum Memory
                    Pool</emphasis>, respectively. Windows will ignore attempts to alter these
                    values through the Java Options field.</para>

            <para>In the same directory you'll also find conversion scripts for earlier Sakai
                versions. Migration from an earlier version will require the successive application
                of all intermediate scripts. You cannot, for example, move from 2.1.1 to 2.2.0 by
                applying a single script. You will need to move first from 2.1.1 to 2.1.2, and then
                to 2.2.0.</para>

                <para>As a general rule, be sure to read through these conversion scripts before
                    applying them. They do not take into account any special customizations you may
                    have made - such as new roles, or the deployment of additional tools - and they
                    may complicate your migration with unintended consequences if you execute them
                    blindly.</para>
                <para>For the 2.2.0 release, the <emphasis>Message Center</emphasis> tool offers one
                    such particular example. A number of schools deployed <emphasis>Message
                    Center</emphasis> in 2.1.x production, before it was yet a provisional tool. Now
                    that it is a provisional tool, the conversion scripts were written to introduce
                    its tables, and thus assume that <emphasis>Message Center</emphasis> is a new
                    tool for your deployment. If it isn't, you'll want to comment out the portions
                    of the conversion script that treat it, and instead perform the following

                    As it turns out, maven does not read <command>JAVA_OPTS</command> when it starts
                    up, and so if your build output complains of "Out of Memory" errors you'll need
                    to set an additional environment variable, namely,
                    <command>MAVEN_OPTS</command>. The value in the sample Unix command below should
                    be more than enough:</para>
                <screen>
export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx384m -XX:PermSize=48m"</screen>

                <title>Uninformative failure messages</title>
                <para>If you need more detailed output to track down a build error, maven can be run
                    in debug mode by adding the -x argument, e.g. <command>maven
                -x</command>.</para>

                <title>Building only a single module</title>
                <para>If you'd like to have the Sakai build targets and goals available for building
                    only a single module (i.e. instead of rebuilding the entire source tree again to
                    accomplish this), then you'll want to have the maven plugin for Sakai installed.
                    Installing the plugin makes it available whenever you use maven, not just for
                    those projects that declare a dependency on the plugin. You will need to do this
                    once each time you upgrade a minor point version of sakai.</para>

maven plugin:download -DgroupId=sakaiproject -DartifactId=sakai -Dversion=2.2</screen>
                <para>Note that the version you should use in the above command is the one found as
                    the value of the <command>sakai.plugin.version</command> property in the
                        <filename>sakai/master/project.properties</filename> file. It is not
                    necessarily (and in fact often isn't) the same as the version of Sakai you're
                    using.</para>

                <title>Finding the Tomcat logs</title>
                <para>Once you have Sakai installed, configured and started, you can monitor Sakai
                    by watching the logs. The log level for the standard Sakai source code and the
                    demo is set to show <emphasis>info</emphasis> and <emphasis>warnings</emphasis>
                    only. Watch for the WARN: messages. There are going to be some "normal" ones at
                    startup, and some will likely slip by at runtime, but any warning is potentially
                    something you might want to check out.</para>
                <note>
                    <title>Changing the Log Configuration</title>
                    <para>To change the logging for Sakai, you need to change Sakai source code and
                        re-deploy sakai. The file you need to change is
                            <filename>sakai-src/kernel/log-configure/src/conf/log4j.properties</filename>,
                        and the relevant property is:</para>
                    <screen>
log4j.logger.org.sakaiproject=INFO</screen>
                    <para>To turn on debug logging for all of Sakai, change that value from INFO to
                        DEBUG. In order to turn on debug logging for just a single component of
                        Sakai, add a line such as in the following example, which will leave most of
                        Sakai at INFO, but generate DEBUG level messages for the SQL service:</para>
                    <screen>
log4j.logger.org.sakaiproject=INFO
log4j.logger.org.sakaiproject.component.framework.sql.BasicSqlService=DEBUG</screen>
                    <para>As you can see, Sakai uses log4j for logging: see official log4j
                        documentation for more information about how to configure it.</para>
                </note>
                <para>For Mac and *nix systems, the most important log is found in
                        <filename>logs/catalina.out</filename> of Tomcat. It can be instructive to
                    watch this log as Tomcat is starting up, by using a startup command like the
                    following:</para>
                <screen>
bin/startup.sh; tail -f logs/catalina.out</screen>
                <para>Tomcat on Windows tends to be a little more puzzling about its logs, and it
                    includes more of them, but its default behavior is to open catalina.out in a new
                    window as soon as you start Tomcat. If you need more information about the logs
                    in Windows, we'll refer you to the official Tomcat documentation.</para>

                    Tomcat is not coming up, and you'll need to go back and change something before
                    it will.</para>
                <para>Unfortunately, there are quite a number of reasons this might have happened.
                    The simplest such cause is that you have not added the Tomcat compatibility
                    package to your installation (see <link linkend="install-env-tinstall">Set up
                        Build Environment</link>). All the other cases involve some problem with
                    your code or platform; these problems are more subtle, and the associated
                        <filename>catalina.out</filename> messages are usually not very helpful in
                    tracking them down.</para>
                <para>To aid in debugging these problems, Josh Holtzman of Berkeley has created what
                    he calls a "Noisy Spring" jar. You can find a full explanation and a link to the
                    jar in the <emphasis>Sakaipedia</emphasis> at <link
                        xl:href="http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence/display/ENC/Noisy+Spring+JAR"
                        >http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence/display/ENC/Noisy+Spring+JAR</link>.
                    Deploying this jar will produce a more Shakespearian death in its
                verbosity.</para>

                <title>"Unsupported major.minor version 49.0"</title>
                <para>If this message appears in catalina.out during startup, it means that you've
                    built Sakai for Java 1.5, but your JRE is 1.4. Go back to the <link
                        linkend="install-env-jenv">Set up Build Environment</link> section and
                    double-check your Java version and environment variables.</para>

                    other application is already running on the port you've assigned for this Tomcat
                    instance. It's most likely another Tomcat. It may be that you didn't stop Tomcat
                    from a previous run, or you may already have Tomcat running on that machine.</para>
                <para>If you need to run more than one Tomcat on the same machine, see Tomcat
                    documentation for instructions on how to configure to run Tomcat on a different
                    port.</para>
