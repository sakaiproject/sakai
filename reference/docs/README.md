# Reference

This directory with legacy documentation, licenses and conversions has been moved to it's own project at [Reference Project](https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai-reference). The official conversion scripts are also located in this project in the [conversion script directory](https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai-reference/tree/master/docs/conversion). This is just left as information for finding those directories.
