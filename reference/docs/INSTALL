1. Overview

  1.1. Choose an Install Type

   Sakai 2.2.0 downloads are available for three different installation
   methods:

   Demo:   This archive provides the quickest and easiest way to try out
           Sakai. It includes the Tomcat container and pre-built webapps, so
           that the only prerequisite for getting started is Java (v. 1.4.2
           or higher).
           
   Binary: This archive is a kind of Tomcat overlay. If you have a working
           Tomcat appropriately configured, the binary installation provides
           a quick way to drop the Sakai application bundle into place
           without requiring a maven build. This may be a good choice if you
           know you don't need to make any code-level changes.
           
   Source: This archive includes only the source code to build Sakai, and
           therefore calls for separate, preparatory installations of Tomcat
           and the Maven build tool, along with (most likely) a preferred
           database. The installation and configuration of these components
           comprises the bulk of this installation guide.

  1.2. Demo Installation

   A demo installation is brief and straightforward. The most technically
   challenging aspect of a demo install is making sure that your Java
   environment is squared away in advance. The steps are as follows:

    1. Verify Java Installation and Environment Variables (see the first two
       sections of Set up Environment).

    2. Download and unpack the Demo archive

          * Windows demo archive

          * Mac/*nix archive

    3. Start Tomcat with the following commands from the root Tomcat
       directory:

       Windows:  start-sakai.bat
       Mac/*nix: start-sakai.sh

   Once Tomcat is started up, you can point your browser to
   http://localhost:8080/portal. This will bring you to the Sakai gateway
   site, from which you can create new accounts and log in to the syste. For
   more orienting tips on how to begin using Sakai, skip ahead to [43]Getting
   Started with the Software.

   To stop the demo:

   Windows:  stop-sakai.bat
   Mac/*nix: stop-sakai.sh

  Special notes about the Demo installation

   Data storage: The data for a demo installation is stored in a
                 HypersonicSQL database (HSQLDB) which is stored in memory
                 and then written out to files when Tomcat is shut down.
                 These files are located at sakai-demo/sakai/db/sakai.db.*.
   Email not     The Sakai demo is configured to neither send nor receive
   configured:   email.

  1.3. Binary Installation

   The Binary installation of Sakai provides a shortcut for those that
   already have Tomcat in place and configured as needed (see [44]Set up
   Environment for details on Tomcat configuration), and it does so by
   providing a pre-built Sakai that can simply be dropped into place. All you
   need to do is unpack the binary archive at the root Tomcat directory, and
   the appropriate wars, jars, etc., will be deposited in the correct
   locations.

   If you wish to configure a binary installation you'll need to manually
   create a sakai directory in $CATALINA_HOME to hold your sakai.properties
   file, as described in Post-Installation Configuration.

  1.4. Source Installation

   The Demo and Binary installs described above provide quick ways to get up
   and running, but assume that no code-level changes are called for. The
   remainder of this installation guide devotes itself to the more rigorous
   and customizable Source installation, although some of its details (e.g.
   the post-installation configuration) may also be pertinent for more
   sophisticated uses of the demo and binary installs. The full set of steps
   for a Source installation may be organized into the following phases:

    1. Set up Environment, including Java, Tomcat, and Maven.

    2. Build and Deploy Sakai by running Maven.

    3. Perform appropriate Post-installation Configuration of the
       application.

    4. If you want to configure Sakai for either MySQL or Oracle, perform the
       requisite Database Configuration.

  1.5. Migrating from a Previous Release

   Since there have been a number of changes in tools, DB schema, and APIs,
   migrating to 2.2 from a previous release requires close attention to
   detail. Be sure to go over the release notes carefully, and a few key
   hurdles are identified below:

   sakai.properties:      The 2.2 framework refactoring means that many
                          package names have changed, and these differences
                          will mainly be encountered in sakai.properties
                          settings which reference beans. It's best to not
                          try to use a sakai.properties from a previous
                          release, and instead start with the sample in
                          reference/docs/sakai.properties.
                          
   DB conversion scripts: Every release has DB conversion scripts, and 2.2 is
                          no exception. Be sure, however, to read these
                          scripts over carefully before executing them on
                          your production data. They do not take into account
                          any special customizations you may have done, and
                          you may need to alter them for your situation. See
                          the Database Configuration section for more
                          details.
                          
   Provisional tools:     A few contrib tools that schools may have already
                          put into production are now provisional with the
                          2.2 release. The DB conversion scripts in
                          particular assume that these new provisional tools
                          are not represented in your schema, and attempt to
                          introduce them. If you have already deployed
                          Message Center, Post 'Em, Search, or Summary
                          Calendar on a production system, you'll want to be
                          sure to avoid running the portions of the
                          conversion scripts that pertain to them. Again, see
                          the Database Configuration section for more
                          details.
                          
   Providers:             Among the changes that 2.2 introduces is a
                          separation of external user identifiers from
                          Sakai's internal user ids. Any custom
                          UserDirectoryProvider will need some alteration to
                          account for this, along with changes to its import
                          statements and declarations that stem from API
                          changes. See the release notes for more
                          details.

2. Set up Environment

  2.1. Verify Java Installation

   Check to see if you have Java (version 1.4.2 or higher) installed on your
   system by running the following command (sample output from a *nix
   system):

 $ java -version
 java version "1.5.0_06"
 Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_06-b05)
 Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 1.5.0_06-b05, mixed mode)

   If you're going to be building the source (i.e. if you chose the source
   install) then you'll want to make sure that you have also installed the
   full J2SE, and not just the JRE.

  JRE vs. JDK vs. J2SE vs. J2EE

   If you're unfamiliar with the Java world, you may find the acronyms for
   various Java environments a little mysterious. The JRE is simply the
   "runtime environment" which allows you to execute compiled Java bytecode,
   and for many platforms this is all you usually get by default - for the
   very good reason that the average user just wants to run programs, and
   doesn't need to be building code. The JRE is what Tomcat needs to start
   up, and if all you're installing is the Sakai demo or binary, then the JRE
   will suffice for you.

   To build the Sakai source, however, you'll need the JDK, which stands for
   "Java Developer's Kit." To both build and run Sakai you'll therefore need
   a combination of both the JDK and the JRE, and, happily, Sun makes this
   available as a unit: the J2SE (the "Java 2 Standard Edition").

   If you go to the Sun site for a download, you may also run across the J2EE
   (the "Enterprise Edition"), or even the J2ME (the "Micro Edition"). Don't
   trouble yourself with these, unless you know of a particular reason why
   you may want them - neither is necessary for a Sakai installation.

  2.2. Verify Java Environment Variables

   There are three Java environment variables you'll want to set for
   everything to function as it should, and though some of them may have
   already been set by your Java installation (depending on your platform),
   you'll want to double-check them all. You can also look at the Sun
   Java Installation Instructions page at the Java web site for further
   details.

   First you'll need to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to
   the base directory of your Java installation, which will enable Tomcat to
   find it. In UNIX operating systems you typically modify a startup file
   like ~/.bash_login to set and export these shell variables, while for
   Windows XP you would go toStart -> Control Panel -> System -> Advanced ->
   Environment Variables and then set them to point to the correct locations
   through the text fields of the GUI (samples below):

   Windows:  Set the (or create a new) environment variable JAVA_HOME to
             C:\jdk1.5.0_06.
   Mac/*nix: export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/java-current

  JRE_HOME

   If your machine has already set JRE_HOME for any reason, or if you want to
   be sure to be using a particular JRE - in the event that you have more
   than one JRE installed on your machine - then you'll want to set the
   JRE_HOME variable as well. JRE_HOME is what Tomcat uses when it starts up,
   but it defaults to use JAVA_HOME if JRE_HOME is not set. For most people,
   then, setting JAVA_HOME will cover both cases sufficiently.

   Next you'll want to append to the PATH variable the location of Java
   commands:

   Windows: Append the string ;C:\jdk1.5.0_06\bin to the end of the system
            variable named Path.
   Mac:     Not necessary.
   *nix:    export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin/

   Finally, you'll need to set an environment variable that will increase the
   size and performance of your JVM ("Java Virtual Machine": the default JVM
   settings are unfortunately not sufficient for Sakai), and the variable is
   named JAVA_OPTS. The value suggested below should be suitable for
   developers or demo installations.

   Windows:  Create a new environment variable JAVA_OPTS to hold the value
             "-server -Xmx512m -Xms512m -XX:PermSize=128m
             -XX:MaxPermSize=196m -XX:NewSize=192m -XX:MaxNewSize=384m".
   Mac/*nix: export JAVA_OPTS="-server -Xmx512m -Xms512m -XX:PermSize=128m
             -XX:MaxPermSize=196m -XX:NewSize=192m -XX:MaxNewSize=384m"

  More on JVM Tuning

   The above JAVA_OPTS settings are, it must be emphasized once again,
   minimal. For settings more suitable for production servers, see the
   JVM Tuning section of Post-Installation Configuration.

   You should test that these variables are set correctly. In both Windows XP
   and *nix operating systems you can simply start a new shell and type the
   set command to see your environment variables.

  2.3. Install Tomcat

   Sakai 2.2.0 was QA'ed with Tomcat 5.5.17, and so that's the version we
   recommend, although the latest stable version will most likely not present
   problems. Tomcat can be downloaded as a binary from
   http://tomcat.apache.org/download-55.cgi. The distribution you want is
   the one labeled Core, along with the JDK 1.4 Compatibility Package (even
   if you're using Java 1.5, some portions of the Sakai code will require the
   compatibility package, and Sakai won't start up without it). The Tomcat
   5.5 instructions will tell you that Java 1.5 is required, but it's not, so
   long as you have the 1.4 Compatibility package.

  Tomcat on Windows

   Windows users have the option of either downloading an .exe Tomcat
   installer (for installing Tomcat as a service) or a .zip binary. Although
   either may serve, they are however not entirely equivalent when it comes
   to operational details, and for brevity's sake it's recommended that you
   grab the .zip. Sakai requires some tuning of the JVM, and the service
   install manages these settings through the registry rather than
   environment variables (see Tomcat installation instructions on the Apache
   site if you're committed to installing Tomcat as a service).

   Unpack the Tomcat archive at your desired location, and unpack the
   compatibility package directly on top of it. From this point forward these
   instructions will refer to the top-level Tomcat directory (e.g.
   /usr/local/apache-tomcat-5.5.17) as $CATALINA_HOME. You may set this as an
   environment variable for convenience's sake, but this is not required.
   Make sure that you have write permissions to the Tomcat files and
   directories before proceeding, or you may later run into errors during the
   build phase.

  2.4. Configure Tomcat

   Sakai supports UTF-8, allowing for non-Roman characters, but this requires
   that Tomcat be configured to accept UTF-8 URLs since it ships with
   ISO-8859-1 as the default URL encoding. To change this setting, edit
   $CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml. Add the attribute URIEncoding="UTF-8" to
   the <connector> element. For example:

 <Connector port="8080" maxThreads="150" minSpareThreads="25" maxSpareThreads="75"
 enableLookups="false" redirectPort="8443" acceptCount="100" debug="0"
 connectionTimeout="20000" disableUploadTimeout="true" URIEncoding="UTF-8"/>

   If you want to run Tomcat on different ports than the defaults, this would
   also be a good time to make those changes in the server.xml file. See
   Tomcat configuration documentation for more details.

   If you're going to run Tomcat as a standalone web server (i.e. if you're
   not going to connect it to the Apache web server) then you'll want to make
   a further minor change that may spare some confusion later. The ROOT
   webapp is the one served up when a request is made to your Tomcat's root
   URL, and so if you want users to be re-directed automatically to the Sakai
   application, you'll want to insert an index.html file into webapps/ROOT
   that prompts this re-direction. It should look something like:

 <html>
     <head>
         <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=/portal">
     </head>
     <body>
         redirecting to /portal ...
     </body>
 </html>

   If you don't make this change you (and your users) will need to append
   '/portal' to the URL entered to access Sakai each time. If you intend to
   connect Tomcat with Apache, you can handle this issue as a matter of
   Apache configuration, which is however outside the scope of this document.

  2.5. Install Maven

   Maven is the build tool used by Sakai, and the latest stable release
   (currently 1.0.2) can be downloaded from
   http://maven.apache.org/start/download.html

  Newer versions of Maven

   It's important that Maven 1.0.2 be used. There are betas for Maven 1.1 and
   Maven 2.0 currently available, but neither will work for Sakai 2.2. Many
   plugins have not yet been adapted for the new Maven architecture.

   Choose a location for Maven, and unpack the archive there. You will have a
   top-level directory named maven-1.0.2.

  2.6. Configure Maven

   To use Maven you'll need to set two more environment variables and then
   create a local repository using a script provided by Maven. Just as with
   the Java variables, MAVEN_HOME should be set, and then Maven's binary
   commands should be added to the Path:

   Windows:  Create a new MAVEN_HOME environment variable to C:\maven-1.0.2.
             Then append to the PATH variable ;C:\maven-1.0.2\bin
   Mac/*nix: export MAVEN_HOME=/usr/local/maven; export
             PATH=$PATH:$MAVEN_HOME/bin

   Next you'll want to create your local maven repository in your home
   directory by running the following command:

   Windows:  install_repo.bat %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\.maven\repository
   Mac/*nix: install_repo.sh $HOME/.maven/repository

  Home Directories in Windows

   You may not often deal with the notion of the home directory on Windows
   systems, but it's still there. By default its location is C:\Documents and
   Settings\yourusername. Windows also establishes it through environment
   variables which you've just seen above - the combination of your "home
   drive" location and your "home path" location: %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH% (The
   %-sign is how Windows brackets environment variables).

   Finally, you'll need to create a build properties file in your home
   directory which will define some basic parameters for your Sakai build.
   Simply create a new text file with the filename build.properties in your
   home directory, and paste in the following contents:

 maven.repo.remote=http://source.sakaiproject.org/maven/
 maven.tomcat.home=/usr/local/tomcat/

  build.properties syntax

   Maven is very sensitive to the syntax of the build.properties file. Be
   sure not to omit the trailing slashes as shown above, and be sure to
   change the value of maven.tomcat.home to match the path to your Tomcat
   installation.

   Further, if you are running on Windows special care is needed in
   identifying your tomcat home. Maven wants Unix-style forward slashes, "/",
   and is confused by Windows-style backslashes "\". If you have your tomcat
   located in c:\tomcat, for example, you need to identify it like this:

 maven.tomcat.home=c:/tomcat/

   Finally, to confirm that you can start Maven, run the command maven -v.
   This should start maven and cause it to report its version. At this point
   your environment is prepared to build and deploy the Sakai source code.

3. Build and Deploy

  How Sakai uses Maven

   The steps below are limited to what you need to get started, but you may
   feel the need to learn more about how Sakai uses Maven. To find the most
   detailed such documentation, look for sakai_maven.doc in
   reference/docs/architecture of the source archive or on subversion at:
   https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/reference/tags/sakai_2-2-0/docs/architecture/sakai_maven.doc

  3.1. Download Source

   If you haven't yet, download the Source archive from
   http://www.sakaiproject.org/release

  Getting the Code from Subversion

   Alternatively, you may check out the source code from subversion. You
   might wish to do this, for example, in order to grab the maintenance
   branch, which will include the latest set of bug fixes. To check out the
   maintenance branch, you can use the following command:

 svn export https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/sakai/branches/sakai_2-2-x/

   In which case you could skip the unpacking step below, and your root
   directory would be sakai_2-2-x instead of sakai-src.

  3.2. Unpack Source

   Choose a location to unpack the Sakai source (your home directory is
   fine), and when you unpack it you will see a directory named sakai-src.

  3.3. Run Maven

   From within the sakai-src directory, run the command maven bld dpl.

  Subsequent builds

   Subsequent builds would be advised to add the "clean" phase by using the
   command maven cln bld dpl, or the equivalent shortcut: maven sakai. See
   the sakai_maven.doc for more details.

   This will run for quite a few minutes with fairly verbose output,
   particularly when it's your first build. Maven will download any
   dependencies into the local repository, compile the Sakai code, and then
   deploy Sakai to Tomcat in the form of .war files in the
   $CATALINA_HOME/webapps directory. If Maven completes with the message
   BUILD SUCCESSFUL, you should be able to move on to the next step. If you
   are greeted with the report BUILD FAILED read the accompanying error
   message carefully to troubleshoot (see the Troubleshooting section).

  Maven and Memory

   You may find that your machine runs out of memory while it is building
   Sakai. As it turns out, maven does not read JAVA_OPTS when it starts up,
   and so if your build output complains of "Out of Memory" errors you'll
   need to set an additional environment variable, namely, MAVEN_OPTS. The
   value in the sample Unix command below should be more than enough:

                     export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx384m -XX:PermSize=48m"

   You will probably be able to start up Tomcat and run Sakai with the
   default configuration at this point, but it would be better to take care
   of some basic post-installation configuration first.

4. Post-Installation Configuration

  4.1. Create folder for properties file

   Sakai runs with a default set of configuration properties for its various
   components. To override them you'll want to specify them in a
   sakai.properties file which should be located in $CATALINA_HOME/sakai by
   default. This directory is not created by maven, so you'll have to do so
   manually.

  Choosing a different location for sakai.properties

   You may find it preferable to store Sakai's configuration files outside of
   the Tomcat file hierarchy. In a development environment, for example, you
   may find yourself frequently blowing Tomcat away, and you'll likely want
   to avoid recreating the sakai folder and its contained file(s) each time.

   To accomplish this, you need only modify the java startup command (or the
   JAVA_OPTS environment variable) to set the system property sakai.home:

 -Dsakai.home=/path/to/desired/sakai/home/

   You'll need to make sure that this location is readable and writable to
   Tomcat.

  4.2. The sakai.properties file

   The main configuration file for Sakai is called sakai.properties, and you
   can either create it from scratch or copy in a known working copy. A
   sample sakai.properties file which self-documents many of the standard
   properties in its comments can be found in the source under
   sakai-src/reference/docs/sakai.properties, while the properties file that
   the OOTB software uses as its default may be found in
   sakai-src/kernel/component/src/config/org/sakaiproject/config/sakai.properties.

   New value settings can be freely added to the sakai.properties file. Since
   any component property can in principle be overridden here, any sample
   sakai.properties will show only a small fraction of all the possible
   settings.

  Learning more about sakai.properties

   Settings in sakai.properties govern everything from setting your
   institution name to configuring your database. The essential settings for
   installation are covered here, but to find the most detailed documentation
   on the full variety of possible sakai.properties settings, look in
   sakai_properties.doc in subversion or
   reference/docs/architecture/sakai_properties.doc of the source archive.

  4.3. Email configuration

   Sakai needs to be set up for two email functions: receiving email sent to
   Sakai sites, and sending out email notifications. For sending mail Sakai
   needs the address (name or IP) of an SMTP server that will accept mail
   from Sakai, and this needs to be set in your sakai.properties file:

 smtp@org.sakaiproject.email.api.EmailService=some.smtp.org

   To enable Sakai to receive mail you'll need to set the following:

 # dns addresses used for incoming email
 smtp.dns.1 = 255.255.255.1
 smtp.dns.2 = 255.255.255.2

 # SMTP port on which our SMTP server runs. Default is 25.
 #Recommend running on 8025, and using a standard mailer on 25 to forward mail to Sakai.
 smtp.port = 25

 # flag to enable or disable our SMTP server for incoming email (true | false)
 smtp.enabled = true

   To disable the SMTP server for incoming email, use this line in
   sakai.properties:

 smtp.enabled=false

   Sakai's SMTP server is James, and to run with the above configuration
   which runs James on the standard SMTP port 25 you must be running with
   admin privileges. Most admins won't want to let Tomcat run with those
   permissions, and would rather run a standard mailer like postfix on port
   25 and configure it to forward requests to Sakai. You might also already
   have a mailer service running on port 25 (Linux usually has it running by
   default), and so you'd want to change the James port simply to avoid a
   conflict. For example:

 smtp.port = 8025

  4.4. JVM Tuning

   The default Java virtual machine is not adequate to run an application of
   Sakai's size, and several JVM parameters must be increased to a certain
   threshold for Sakai to run, while some may be further adjusted for optimal
   performance on your machines.

  Disclaimer

   JVM tuning is, as a general rule, something of a black art, and we
   recommend that you take the time to experiment with different memory and
   garbage collection settings and see what works best in your environment.
   We can make some minimal recommendations that should serve as a foundation
   for further experimentation and testing, but the following details are
   however offered only as samples or suggestions, and we recommend that you
   consult a systems administrator or local Java guru before making any such
   changes to a production system. See the Programmer's Cafe on our
   Confluence wiki for more discussion of the details.

   The standard way to control the JVM options when Tomcat starts up is to
   have an environment variable JAVA_OPTS defined with JVM startup options.
   Since any given Sakai instance may be deployed for a variety of purposes -
   ranging from developers doing private testing to large-scale deployments -
   it's hard to recommend a single set of such options as the preferred ones
   for every case. We can, however, start with a bare minimum which will at
   least avoid "Out of Memory" errors, and be suitable for developer installs
   of the software:

 JAVA_OPTS="-server -Xmx512m -Xms768m -XX:PermSize=128m -XX:MaxPermSize=196m -XX:NewSize=192m -XX:MaxNewSize=384m"

   This is an adequate - if minimal - starting point: it selects server mode,
   sets an adequate heap size, and sizes the permanent generation to
   accommodate more longer-persisting objects. These settings will allow
   things to be functional for testing and development, but will hardly be
   adequate for serving large numbers of concurrent users. A more suitable
   production environment on a 32-bit machine with multiple processors might
   use a set of options like:

 JAVA_OPTS="-server -Xms1500m -Xmx1500m -XX:NewSize=400m -XX:MaxNewSize=400m -XX:PermSize=128m
 -XX:MaxPermSize=196m -verbose:gc -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+UseParNewGC"

   This is better: a larger heap size is set for smoother performance (we
   have found the best results when the min and max memory settings - Xms and
   Xmx, respectively - are set to be the same values), and garbage collection
   messages are turned on. Another important consideration is the ratio of
   NewSize to the size of the heap. We want as large a NewSize as we can fit
   in the total heap, while keeping the total heap significantly bigger than
   NewSize in order for Java to properly garbage collect. The last two
   arguments above can produce a performance improvement if you have two or
   more processors on your machine, however your performance will be better
   if you don't include them for single-processor machines.

   As you can see, there's a lot to think about here, and in practice each
   implementing institution uses their own particular JAVA_OPTS that they've
   settled on for their deployment and hardware, and they often use more
   option arguments than we've shown here. This discussion is meant only as a
   head start, and there is no replacement for doing your own testing.

   Once you set JAVA_OPTS Tomcat will see this environment variable upon
   startup and use it. Instead of putting this in an environment variable you
   might create your own startup script to do so.

  JVM Tuning in Windows XP

   Windows users that have installed Tomcat as a service may set Java options
   in a Tomcat Properties dialog. But you may find that the permanent
   generation settings mentioned above will not work appropriately if set in
   the "Java Options:" field of the dialog window. That's because these
   settings have their own fields in the properties GUI, under the headings
   Initial Memory Pool and Maximum Memory Pool, respectively. Windows will
   ignore attempts to alter these values through the Java Options field.

  4.5. Test Sakai

   At this stage your installation of Sakai has not yet been configured to
   use your preferred database (it will use its own HSQLDB by default), but
   you should now be able to bring it up as a working web application by
   simply starting Tomcat, and it can be helpful at this point to know if any
   problems exist before you try to connect it to another database. Tomcat
   will take a minute or so to start up, depending on the speed of your
   machine, and it's a good idea to watch the Tomcat log as it comes up to
   catch any errors (see Troubleshooting).

   From $CATALINA_HOME you can start up Tomcat with the command:

   Windows:  bin/startup.bat
   Mac/*nix: bin/startup.sh

   Once Tomcat has loaded the Sakai application (again, this can take a
   minute or so) point your browser to http://localhost:8080/portal. If
   the gateway page does not come up, check the Tomcat logs (see the
   Troubleshooting section) for any errors and stack traces. If the
   gateway page does come up, log in with the default admin account (the
   username and password are both 'admin'). If you can log in without errors
   you should be able to stop Tomcat and proceed with Database configuration,
   if needed.

   Windows:  bin/shutdown.bat
   Mac/*nix: bin/shutdown.sh

5. Database Configuration

  5.1. Migrating from an Earlier Version

   There are database schema changes between 2.1.2 and 2.2.0, and the
   conversion scripts to be applied - in distinct versions for MySQL and
   Oracle, respectively - are found in the reference/docs/updating folder of
   the release or on subversion:

MySQL:  https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/reference/tags/sakai_2-2-0/docs/conversion/sakai_2_1_2-2_2_0_mysql_conversion.sql
Oracle: https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/reference/tags/sakai_2-2-0/docs/conversion/sakai_2_1_2-2_2_0_oracle_conversion.sql

   In the same directory you'll also find conversion scripts for earlier
   Sakai versions. Migration from an earlier version will require the
   successive application of all intermediate scripts. You cannot, for
   example, move from 2.1.1 to 2.2.0 by applying a single script. You will
   need to move first from 2.1.1 to 2.1.2, and then to 2.2.0.

  Examine before using

   As a general rule, be sure to read through these conversion scripts before
   applying them. They do not take into account any special customizations
   you may have made - such as new roles, or the deployment of additional
   tools - and they may complicate your migration with unintended
   consequences if you execute them blindly.

   For the 2.2.0 release, the Message Center tool offers one such particular
   example. A number of schools deployed Message Center in 2.1.x production,
   before it was yet a provisional tool. Now that it is a provisional tool,
   the conversion scripts were written to introduce its tables, and thus
   assume that Message Center is a new tool for your deployment. If it isn't,
   you'll want to comment out the portions of the conversion script that
   treat it, and instead perform the following conversions:

  MySQL:  ALTER TABLE MFR_TOPIC_T ADD DEFAULTASSIGNNAME VARCHAR(255);
          ALTER TABLE MFR_OPEN_FORUM_T ADD DEFAULTASSIGNNAME VARCHAR(255);
          ALTER TABLE MFR_MESSAGE_T ADD GRADEASSIGNMENTNAME VARCHAR(255);
          ALTER TABLE MFR_MESSAGE_T ADD GRADECOMMENT VARCHAR(255);
          
  Oracle: ALTER TABLE MFR_TOPIC_T ADD DEFAULTASSIGNNAME VARCHAR2(255) NULL;
          ALTER TABLE MFR_OPEN_FORUM_T ADD DEFAULTASSIGNNAME VARCHAR2(255) NULL;
          ALTER TABLE MFR_MESSAGE_T ADD GRADEASSIGNMENTNAME VARCHAR2(255) NULL;
          ALTER TABLE MFR_MESSAGE_T ADD GRADECOMMENT VARCHAR2(255) NULL;

  5.2. Deploy Drivers

   The supported production-grade databases include MySQL 4.1.12+ (but MySQL
   5.0 has not yet been adequately tested for it to be recommended for
   production) and Oracle 9i+. The version of the JDBC driver (or connector)
   is also important: for MySQL a 3.1.12+ connector should be used, while for
   Oracle the 10g driver must be used, even if the database is Oracle 9i.
   These drivers should be copied into your $CATALINA_HOME/common/lib
   directory, and they are available from the official sites:

MySQL:  http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/3.1.html
Oracle: http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/index.html

  Driver Versions

   Database driver versions are a common source of problems. It's worth
   emphasizing again that the Oracle 10g driver must be used for Sakai
   installations running against Oracle, even when the database is Oracle 9i.

   Problems have been reported for both the 3.1.10 and 3.1.11 MySQL drivers.
   3.1.12 is the recommended version since it has the greatest weight of
   production experience behind hit, however early testing of 3.1.13 has not
   yet revealed any significant issues.

  5.3. Create Database and User

   A Sakai database and privileged user must be prepared for Sakai's use.
   Consult your database documentation for details, but below are sample
   commands for MySQL.

 C:\sakai\reference\sql\legacy\mysql\>
 mysql -u root -p
 Enter password: ******
 Welcome to the MySQL monitor. Commands end with ; or \g.

 Your MySQL connection id is 51 to server version: 4.1.5-gamma-nt

 Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

 mysql> create database sakai default character set utf8;
 Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

 mysql> grant all on sakai.* to sakaiuser@'localhost' identified by 'sakaipassword';
 Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec

 mysql> grant all on sakai.* to sakaiuser@'127.0.0.1' identified by 'sakaipassword';
 Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

 mysql> quit

  UTF-8 Character Set

   When the database is created you must be sure to create it to use the
   UTF-8 character set, just as Tomcat was configured to use UTF-8. If you
   don't you may run into a range of issues when attempting to use Unicode
   characters in Sakai, and this goes for both MySQL and Oracle. Consult your
   DB documentation or a local DBA for instructions on how to do this.

   If you're not certain how your database is currently configured, you can
   check with a query. Here is a sample query from Oracle showing the correct
   value:

 SQL> select value from nls_database_parameters where parameter = 'NLS_CHARACTERSET';

 VALUE
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 AL32UTF8

   Converting a database from one character set to another is non-trivial,
   particularly if it's a large production database, and so it's strongly
   recommended that you verify this aspect of your database creation before
   deploying Sakai.

  5.4. Database Properties

   There are settings in sakai.properties that also define the database
   technology and connection information. Appropriate sakai.properties
   settings for Oracle and MySQL, respectively, are listed below, and you
   need only modify them with your local particulars:

MySQL:  hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
        vendor@org.sakaiproject.db.api.SqlService=mysql
        driverClassName@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
        url@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=jdbc:mysql://SERVER:3306/DB?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8
        username@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=USER
        password@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=PASSWORD
        validationQuery@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=select 1 from DUAL
        defaultTransactionIsolationString@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED
        
Oracle: hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.Oracle9Dialect
        vendor@org.sakaiproject.db.api.SqlService=oracle
        driverClassName@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
        url@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=jdbc:oracle:thin:@SERVER:1521:DB
        username@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=USER
        password@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=PASSWORD
        validationQuery@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=select 1 from DUAL
        defaultTransactionIsolationString@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED

  Oracle Performance

   Oracle may have performance problems with some of the SQL settings that
   work for HSQL and MySQL. Sakai installations using Oracle should strongly
   consider the following settings in sakai.properties to avoid these
   problems:

 # For improved Oracle performance (from the University of Michigan)
 validationQuery@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=
 defaultTransactionIsolationString@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=
 testOnBorrow@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=false

   Oracle should be set to the proper settings for the first two items
   (above) automatically; setting them with each use may affect performace.
   In addition, validating the connection on each transaction caused problems
   in at least one large production environment (University of Michigan).

   Once you've configured the database appropriately, you need only stop and
   restart Tomcat. As Tomcat is coming up you can watch its log to see if
   there are any database connection errors (see the [72]Troubleshooting
   section).

  Oracle and Tests&Quizzes

   If you're running Oracle you should check the datatype of the MEDIA column
   in the SAM_MEDIA_T table. Hibernate tries to choose the right data type
   for a field, but has a habit of choosing the wrong one for Oracle. The
   correct types for each database are:

   HSQL:   varbinary
   MySQL:  longblob
   Oracle: blob

   If you need to change this type for your database, this will also involve
   finding the primary key constraint, dropping it and then recreating it.
   Contact your local DBA for further information on making this change.
   Below is some sample Oracle SQLplus output to better illustrate
   (SYS_C0064435 is the example constraint; replace it with yours):

 SQL> alter table SAM_MEDIA_T modify MEDIA BLOB;

 Table altered.

 SQL> select constraint_name from user_constraints where table_name='SAM_MEDIA_T'
 and CONSTRAINT_TYPE='P';

 CONSTRAINT_NAME
 ------------------------------
 SYS_C0064435

 SQL> alter table sam_media_t drop constraint SYS_C0064435;

 Table altered.

 SQL> alter table SAM_MEDIA_T add constraint SYS_C0064435 primary key (MEDIAID);

 Table altered.

 SQL> desc SAM_MEDIA_T;

 [table with BLOB type]

 SQL> select constraint_name from user_constraints where table_name='SAM_MEDIA_T'
 and CONSTRAINT_TYPE='P';

 CONSTRAINT_NAME
 ------------------------------
 SYS_C0064435

 SQL> commit;

 Commit complete.

6. Getting Started with the Software

   You should at this point have a working Sakai installation. Now it's time
   to get started with adding users, creating work sites, and otherwise
   playing around with the tools. We won't try to present a full user's guide
   here, but we can offer some pointers to get you oriented and on your way,
   and link you to more exhaustive sources of information elsewhere.

  6.1. The Gateway Page

   When Tomcat has come up successfully, you should be able to direct your
   browser to its gateway page at http://localhost:8080/portal (or
   replace 'localhost' with the name of the server where it's installed).
   From the gateway page you can create new accounts or browse for public
   site content. You could start by creating a new account, but that can also
   be done as an admin, and since the admin functions are needed to allow
   this account the right permissions, it's just as well to start by logging
   in as the admin user. Sakai's out-of-the-box admin account is simply named
   'admin' (with password also 'admin'), so use those credentials to log in.

  6.2. My Workspace

   Every user on the system - including the admin - has a private site called
   My Workspace. It's the landing point upon logging in, and it's the first
   site tab visible at the upper left. Running vertically along the left-hand
   side of the screen are links to the various different tool pages within a
   given site, and the admin's My Workspace has a different set of such
   options here than most (each different type of account can be configured
   to have a different set of tools in its My Workspace by altering a
   template - see below).

  6.3. Other Sites

   Each new (accessible) site becomes visible as a tab along the top, to the
   right of My Workspace. For most users, they initially only have access to
   one site - their My Workspace. The admin user is a little different, in
   that it has access to two.

   The second admin site (which you can enter by clicking on its tab) is
   entitled Administration Workspace which, strangely enough, looks exactly
   the same as the admin My Workspace. It is.

   Why the redundancy? Because you'll likely want to make these admin tools
   available to a particular user who doesn't have access to the admin's My
   Workspace (no one has access to other people's My Workspace on the
   system). To allow anyone access to the admin tools, you need only add them
   to the list of users of the Administration Workspace, and then promote
   them in the site to the "admin" role.

  6.4. Admin Tools

    6.4.1. Creating Users

   The first thing you may want to do is to change the admin password to
   something secure, and to start creating a few sample users on your system.
   You can do both of those tasks through the Users tool on the left. To
   change the admin user's password, simply click on the 'admin' username in
   the list of users, and edit the fields on the subsequent page. To create
   users, click on the New User action link at the top of the tool page.

    6.4.2. Creating Sites

   If you're itching to create your first worksite, you may be tempted to
   dive directly into the Sites tool. That would probably be a mistake. The
   Sites tool is a powerful way to construct an entire site from the ground
   up, with fine-grained control over its every page, tool, and configuration
   detail. But this flexible power comes with a price, making for an
   intimidating interface and epic-scale workflow. The Sites tool is
   therefore best used as a way to tweak an existing site after the fact,
   once the standard pieces have been more expediently assembled.

   The best way to start creating sites, therefore, is to use the Worksite
   Setup tool. Click on the New link at the top of the tool page, and then,
   for simplicity's sake, choose the Project site type, which will allow you
   to avoid issues of academic term, etc., that are provoked by a "course"
   site - issues which are probably unnecessary if you just want to start
   playing with the tools. Either type of site will serve, however: both
   types of sites have all the tools available to them.

   Step through the remaining site creation pages, making your preferred
   selections. Be sure to click the Create Site button at the end of the
   process. After doing so, you should see the site title visible as a new
   tab along the top of the screen.

    6.4.3. Adding Users to Sites

   Since you set this site up as an admin, the admin is technically the owner
   of this site, and its only member at first. If you want to add other
   sample users to this site in different roles, you can do so through the
   Site Info tool of the site itself.

   Click on the tab of your new site (which should now be visible) to enter
   it, and then click on the Site Info link along the lefthand side. Site
   Info has a number of site maintainer functions available as action links
   across the top, and Add Participants is the one that will allow you to
   connect other users to the site. These users will of course need to have
   been previously created.

   As long as we're here in Site Info, it's worth pointing out that the Edit
   Tools link at the top will allow you to remove and add tools from the
   site.

  6.5. Experimenting with Tools

   You may have noticed an extra tool appear in your site - one which you
   didn't explicitly choose - labeled Help. This tool provides online
   documentation of the various bundle tools, and other facets of the system.
   This should be your companion as you learn more about the software's
   functionality.

   This Help tool is also reached in a context-sensitive way by clicking on
   the question mark icons at the upper right of any particular tool frame.
   Clicking on those question marks will open up the precise content of the
   tool you happen to be in at the time.

   At some later point, when you become comfortable with the standard tools,
   you may wish to see other, more experimental tools that are available for
   Sakai. The Sakai distribution includes provisional tools that are still
   maturing, but can already serve needs in innovative ways that the standard
   ones do not. These extra tools require additional steps to enable, so that
   system users will not stumble across them inadvertently if that's not
   desired, but you are encouraged to evaluate them for your own deployment.
   See http://source.sakaiproject.org/release/2.2.0/provisional.html for
   more details.

  6.6. Where to Learn More

   Sakai information has been unfortunately a little fragmented to date.
   Attempts are underway to consolidate and present this information in a
   more uniform way, but in the interim a tourist's guide of the landmarks
   may be in order.

    6.6.1. About the Project

   The sakaiproject.org site offers the best background and orientation
   to the project and its goals, but chances are you've already seen it. For
   more particular information on the progress and roadmaps of certain tools
   or other initiatives, see the Confluence space named
   Management/Project Coordination. That coordinating page will also link
   you out to Confluence spaces for particular tools, and documentation about
   them.

    6.6.2. Community Participation

   The Sakai community hosts its own Sakai installation to serve up
   collaboration sites for its various sub-groups, and for direct interaction
   with community members you should join sites there that may be of
   interest. You can create an account there by visiting
   http://collab.sakaiproject.org and clicking on the New Account button.
   Once your account is created you can log in, and with the Membership tool
   you may join any worksites that may seem appropriate. Joining a site
   automatically adds you to its email list, and unjoining a worksite
   similarly removes you (while, it should be noted, sending an "unsubscribe"
   email will not).

    6.6.3. About Technical Matters

   Reference materials for various technical issues are best found in Sakai's
   subversion repository (where these installation documents are also stored)
   or in the project's Confluence wiki. The docs in subversion can be
   found in the reference module, e.g.
   https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/reference. See in particular the
   docs/architecture folder contained there, which contains a wide-ranging
   collection of technical white papers.

   The Confluence wiki is a more informal source of information, but also
   valuable and broader in scope. New developers in particular should visit
   the Programmer's Cafe, while the Sakaipedia provides nuggets of
   insight on a wide array of issues. You're encouraged to create an account
   there and participate.

   But often the most incisive information comes from direct interaction with
   your peers. As mentioned above, the Collab Server is the place to go
   for this. For technical questions the best (and most active) such group is
   DG: Development, also commonly referred to by its alias, "sakai-dev."

7. Troubleshooting

   Below are a number of common issues encountered while building and
   starting up Sakai, but you may also benefit from the expert opinions that
   reside on the sakai-dev list. To join, visit collab.sakaiproject.org,
   create a new account, log in to your My Workspace, and then use the
   Membership tool to join the group named DG: Development. Then you can
   begin to send emails to (and receive them from)
   sakai-dev@collab.sakaiproject.org. To later unsubscribe, you can simply
   use the same Membership tool to unjoin the site.

  7.1. Build Issues

    7.1.1. JAR download failures

   A first build of Maven on a fresh installation may warn of numerous jar
   download failures if you include the clean phase. This is a nuisance, but
   not otherwise a problem. Even when doing a clean maven tries to download
   all dependencies, including those Sakai jars that may not be built until
   the later build phase. Once they are built and placed into the repository,
   maven is perfectly happy for the next "clean build" cycle. The upshot is
   that you may see these errors for your first build, but you shouldn't see
   them for subsequent builds. It also means that you're better off not
   including the clean phase during your first build of a new version of the
   code.

   If this does not account for the download failures you're seeing, then you
   may want to double-check your maven.remote.repo setting. See the [83]Maven
   Configuration section, and follow it precisely.

    7.1.2. Out of Memory errors

   You may find that your machine runs out of memory while it is building
   Sakai. As it turns out, maven does not read JAVA_OPTS when it starts up,
   and so if your build output complains of "Out of Memory" errors you'll
   need to set an additional environment variable, namely, MAVEN_OPTS. The
   value in the sample Unix command below should be more than enough:

 export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx384m -XX:PermSize=48m"

    7.1.3. Uninformative failure messages

   If you need more detailed output to track down a build error, maven can be
   run in debug mode by adding the -x argument, e.g. maven -x.

    7.1.4. Building only a single module

   If you'd like to have the Sakai build targets and goals available for
   building only a single module (i.e. instead of rebuilding the entire
   source tree again to accomplish this), then you'll want to have the maven
   plugin for Sakai installed. Installing the plugin makes it available
   whenever you use maven, not just for those projects that declare a
   dependency on the plugin. You will need to do this once each time you
   upgrade a minor point version of sakai.

 maven plugin:download -DgroupId=sakaiproject -DartifactId=sakai -Dversion=2.2

   Note that the version you should use in the above command is the one found
   as the value of the sakai.plugin.version property in the
   sakai/master/project.properties file. It is not necessarily (and in fact
   often isn't) the same as the version of Sakai you're using.

  7.2. Tomcat Startup Issues

    7.2.1. Finding the Tomcat logs

   Once you have Sakai installed, configured and started, you can monitor
   Sakai by watching the logs. The log level for the standard Sakai source
   code and the demo is set to show info and warnings only. Watch for the
   WARN: messages. There are going to be some "normal" ones at startup, and
   some will likely slip by at runtime, but any warning is potentially
   something you might want to check out.

  Changing the Log Configuration

   To change the logging for Sakai, you need to change Sakai source code and
   re-deploy sakai. The file you need to change is
   sakai-src/kernel/log-configure/src/conf/log4j.properties, and the relevant
   property is:

 log4j.logger.org.sakaiproject=INFO

   To turn on debug logging for all of Sakai, change that value from INFO to
   DEBUG. In order to turn on debug logging for just a single component of
   Sakai, add a line such as in the following example, which will leave most
   of Sakai at INFO, but generate DEBUG level messages for the SQL service:

 log4j.logger.org.sakaiproject=INFO
 log4j.logger.org.sakaiproject.component.framework.sql.BasicSqlService=DEBUG

   The logging controls are part of the new LogConfigurationManager,
   implemented as a component, the Log4jConfigurationManager, in the util
   module. It can be disabled, if we really don't want it to do anything,
   with an entry in sakai.properties:

 enabled@org.sakaiproject.log.api.LogConfigurationManager = false

   Logging levels are first established in the log4j configuration file we
   deploy from Sakai. The source for this file is in:
   sakai/util/util-impl/log/src/conf/log4j.properties. This is made into a
   jar and deployed to common (this is a requirement of log4j configuration
   in Tomcat). We can set logging levels in this file. For example:

 # Application logging options
 log4j.logger.org.sakaiproject=INFO

 # Ignore erroneous MyFaces variable resolver warnings
 log4j.logger.org.apache.myfaces.el.VariableResolverImpl=ERROR

   This sets any logger with "org.sakaiproject.*" to INFO level, and the
   "org.apache.myfaces.el.VariableResolverImpl" to ERROR level. The problem
   with this approach, however, is that it requires a change to the source,
   and a redeploy. Hardly convenient.

   Happily, logging levels can now also be specified in sakai.properties.
   This augments and overrides the levels set in the default config file.
   Example:

 log.config.count=3
 log.config.1 = ALL.org.sakaiproject.log.impl
 log.config.2 = OFF.org.sakaiproject
 log.config.3 = DEBUG.org.sakaiproject.db.impl

   This uses the established (but awkward) method of having a name.count
   followed by name.1, name,2, etc. to form an array of strings for the value
   "name". In this case, the name is "log.config". The values are of the form
   LEVEL.logger, and the possible levels are: OFF TRACE DEBUG INFO WARN ERROR
   FATAL ALL.

   As you can see, Sakai uses log4j for logging. See the official log4j
   documentation for more information about how to configure it if you have
   questions.

   For Mac and *nix systems, the most important log is found in
   logs/catalina.out of Tomcat. It can be instructive to watch this log as
   Tomcat is starting up, by using a startup command like the following:

 bin/startup.sh; tail -f logs/catalina.out

   Tomcat on Windows tends to be a little more puzzling about its logs, and
   it includes more of them, but its default behavior is to open catalina.out
   in a new window as soon as you start Tomcat. If you need more information
   about the logs in Windows, we'll refer you to the official Tomcat
   documentation.

  Other Logs

   The SMTP server logs from Sakai will be written to the
   $CATALINA_HOME/sakai/logs directory.

    7.2.2. Startup halts with destroy messages

   If you see those destroy messages, that's the end of it. Tomcat is not
   coming up, and you'll need to go back and change something before it will.

   Unfortunately, there are quite a number of reasons this might have
   happened. The simplest such cause is that you have not added the Tomcat
   compatibility package to your installation (see Set up Build
   Environment). All the other cases involve some problem with your code or
   platform; these problems are more subtle, and the associated catalina.out
   messages are usually not very helpful in tracking them down.

   To aid in debugging these problems, Josh Holtzman of Berkeley has created
   what he calls a "Noisy Spring" jar. You can find a full explanation and a
   link to the jar in the Sakaipedia at
   http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence/display/ENC/Noisy+Spring+JAR.
   Deploying this jar will produce a more Shakespearian death in its
   verbosity.

    7.2.3. "Unsupported major.minor version 49.0"

   If this message appears in catalina.out during startup, it means that
   you've built Sakai for Java 1.5, but your JRE is 1.4. Go back to the
   [86]Set up Build Environment section and double-check your Java version
   and environment variables.

    7.2.4. "java.net.BindException: Address already in use"

   If this message appears in catalina.out during startup, it means that some
   other application is already running on the port you've assigned for this
   Tomcat instance. It's most likely another Tomcat. It may be that you
   didn't stop Tomcat from a previous run, or you may already have Tomcat
   running on that machine.

   If you need to run more than one Tomcat on the same machine, see Tomcat
   documentation for instructions on how to configure to run Tomcat on a
   different port.
