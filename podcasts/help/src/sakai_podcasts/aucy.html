<h2>Podcasts: Overview</h2>

<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>The Podcasts tool allows site leaders to store and distribute
multimedia content to site participants. Participants may download
materials manually or via an RSS feed. Content can take
many different forms, including audio lectures, video presentations,
and slideshow presentations.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Subscription:</strong> Site participants can download
podcasts individually or subscribe to an RSS feed, which allows
podcasts to be downloaded automatically to a podcatcher.</p>

<p><strong>File types:</strong> Several different file types are
supported within a podcast, including <code>.mp3</code>,
<code>.mp4</code>, and <code>.ppt</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Adding the Podcasts tool:</strong> You can add the Podcasts
tool to your site using Site
Info. For instructions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardx">Adding, editing, or removing tools</a>.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>You can download and view or listen to podcasts on most computers with
podcatcher software. You do not need to own an iPod to consume podcasts.
